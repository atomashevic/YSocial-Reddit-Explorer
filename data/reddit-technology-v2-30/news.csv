<p>OpenAI is reportedly acquiring Windsurf, an AI-powered coding assistant, for approximately $3 billion.</p>



<p>The acquisition comes just months after Windsurf explored funding at this same valuation from investors, highlighting the premium being placed on specialized AI coding capabilities, reported <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/openai-reaches-agreement-to-buy-startup-windsurf-for-3-billion"">Bloomberg</a>, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p>



<p>The deal, which is yet to be closed, represents OpenAI’s largest acquisition to date and marks a significant escalation in the increasingly competitive AI developer tools landscape.</p>



<p>Neither OpenAI nor Windsurf responded to requests for comment on the transaction.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""deal-to-strengthen-openais-developer-tools-portfolio"">Deal to strengthen OpenAI’s developer tools portfolio</h2>



<p>Windsurf, formerly known as Codeium, has gained recognition for its AI-assisted coding capabilities that help developers write and review code more efficiently.</p>



<p>“Windsurf offers AI-native coding tools with dynamic refactoring, enterprise-grade codebase management, and real-time collaboration tailored for large-scale environments,” said Charlie Dai, VP and principal analyst at Forrester. “Windsurf’s enterprise traction and alignment with OpenAI’s ‘<a href=""https://www.infoworld.com/article/3960574/vibe-code-or-retire.html"">vibe coding</a>’ vision justify the strategic acquisition to dominate AI-assisted development.”</p>



<p>Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, said, “Windsurf’s strength lies in its inference-time context compression, low-latency design, and modular fine-tuning—all crucial for regulated industries.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""shifting-competitive-landscape"">Shifting competitive landscape</h2>



<p>The acquisition could reshape the competitive landscape for AI coding tools, where several major players have established positions.</p>



<p>Microsoft-owned GitHub continues enhancing its Copilot offering, leveraging its dominant position in code repositories. Meanwhile, Anthropic has strengthened the coding capabilities of its Claude models, and venture capital-backed startups, including Anysphere, creator of Cursor, have secured funding for specialized coding experiences.</p>



<p>“This acquisition will enhance OpenAI’s AI coding capabilities and expand its market influence, intensifying competition with other rivals in the market,” Dai said.</p>



<p>Neil Shah, VP for research and partner at Counterpoint Research, said that with Windsurf’s potential acquisition, OpenAI can corner a lion’s share of AI-driven coding platforms market for its base OpenAI Codex, as it already powers Microsoft’s GitHub CoPilot and already is being integrated as an option to Claude also within Cursor. “This will definitely affect Anthropic’s share in this space.”</p>



<p>“So, competitively this gives greater significance to Anthropic’s close partnership with Anysphere’s Cursor coding platform, which is its largest customer,” Shah added.</p>



<p>The deal follows OpenAI’s <a href=""https://openai.com/index/march-funding-updates/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent completion</a> of a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank Group Corp., which valued the company at $300 billion. The financial resources from this round have positioned OpenAI to pursue strategic acquisitions despite recently abandoning plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""strategic-implications"">Strategic implications</h2>



<p>For OpenAI, the acquisition represents more than just adding a new product to its portfolio. “For OpenAI, this move is not just about competing with GitHub Copilot—it’s about building a developer-native experience that reduces dependency on Microsoft infrastructure and captures first-party usage telemetry,” explained Gogia. “This acquisition marks a new chapter in OpenAI’s enterprise push.”</p>



<p>“OpenAI’s full-stack control via Windsurf resets competitive dynamics in the AI coding assistant race,” Gogia continued. “GitHub Copilot is deeply integrated into Microsoft’s IDEs, while Anthropic leans toward abstract API usage with little IDE traction. Windsurf gives OpenAI the missing link — a developer-native interface that can be decoupled from ChatGPT, deployed flexibly, and fine-tuned at the source.”</p>



<p>According to Counterpoint Research’s Shah, it is pretty clear from OpenAI’s strategy that they want to scale and train their models, which therefore needs maximum integrations on the consumer as well as the enterprise side. “With Microsoft’s backing, deeper integration within Microsoft’s offerings as well as other potential acquisitions, OpenAI is broadening and deepening integrations for its <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html"">LLM</a> which will help both scale as well as train the model to make it richer and better.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""enterprise-implications"">Enterprise implications</h2>



<p>For enterprise customers, the acquisition raises questions about product integration and future availability. Current Windsurf users may eventually see their tools incorporated into OpenAI’s broader product suite, though the companies have not announced integration plans.</p>



<p>“Enterprises need not rush to switch but should reassess their AI strategy,” Dai said. “Windsurf’s technical strengths and OpenAI’s resources make it a compelling option for businesses prioritizing cutting-edge AI coding capabilities, while competitors may respond with enhanced features. Flexibility and ongoing evaluation will be key as the market evolves.”</p>



<p>According to Shah, GenAI-driven coding is incredibly transformative and can help streamline coding with greater awareness of the codebase, proactive debugging, and automate code development, all with natural prompts and interaction. “This is the holy grail and future of software development, driving significant efficiencies, speed, and accuracy for enterprises and developers.”</p>



<p>He added that enterprises will have to be flexible about choosing the LLM powering their choice of IDE, depending on their codebase, development goals, privacy considerations, and existing integration into Microsoft’s ecosystem from Visual Studio to GitHub. “Diversification not only from a cost perspective but also from the broader macro and micro factors needs to be considered,” he said.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""integration-challenges"">Integration challenges</h2>



<p>The successful integration of Windsurf’s technology into OpenAI’s ecosystem will be critical to realizing the acquisition’s potential value, analysts feel.</p>



<p>“Windsurf’s value lies not just in model performance but in its IDE-native, latency-minimising experience,” said Gogia. “If OpenAI absorbs Windsurf into a ChatGPT-style monolith, it risks losing developer trust. Maintaining modularity, backward compatibility, and interface clarity will be key to long-term traction.”</p>



<p>As the transaction moves toward closing, developers and enterprise customers will be watching for announcements regarding product roadmaps, pricing, and integration timelines.</p>

<p>At Meta’s first <a href=""https://www.llama.com/events/llamacon/2025/?linkId=100000362755559"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LlamaCon AI event</a> last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said AI now writes up to 30% of the company’s code — and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that his company is developing an AI model to create future programs for its AI systems.</p>



<p>“Our bet is sort of that in the next year probably…, maybe half the development is going to be done by AI, as opposed to people, and then that will just kind of increase from there,” Zuckerberg said.</p>



<p>AI-augmented coding tools are set to revolutionize software development by creating source code, generating tests automatically, and freeing up developer time for innovation instead of debugging code. Some industry forecasts <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">predict a 30% productivity boost from AI tools</a>, potentially adding more than $1.5 trillion to global GDP.</p>



<p>One of the most popular AI-assisted coding methods now is known as “vibe coding,” or using natural language prompts (NLP) in a conversational way. Generative AI (genAI) tools are  capable of offering contextual ideas and generating code based on the conversation.</p>



<p>By 2028, 75% of professional developers will be using vibe coding and other genAI-powered coding tools, up from less than 10% in September 2023, <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-04-11-gartner-says-75-percent-of-enterprise-software-engineers-will-use-ai-code-assistants-by-2028"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">according to Gartner Research</a>. And within three years, 80% of enterprises will have integrated AI-augmented testing tools into their software engineering toolchain — a significant increase from approximately 15% early last year, Gartner said.</p>



<p>A <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/94-of-business-leaders-are-using-generative-a%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dt-technology-review-insights-research-report-302279201.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">report from MIT Technology Review Insights</a> found that 94% of business leaders now use genAI in software development, with 82% applying it in multiple stages — and 26% in four or more.</p>



<p>Some industry experts place genAI’s use in creating code much higher. “What we are finding is that we’re three to six months from a world where AI is writing 90% of the code. And then in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code,” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in <a href=""https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/work-productivity/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-says-ai-will-write-90-percent-of-code-in-6-months"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">a recent report</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F27gYnB8LTg"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">video interview</a>.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""a-real-shift-in-software-creation"">A real shift in software creation</h2>



<p>While that timeline might sound bold, it points to a real shift in how software is built, with trends like vibe coding already taking off. Diego Lo Giudice, a vice president analyst at Forrester Research, said even senior developers are starting to leverage vibe as an additional tool. But he believes vibe coding and other AI-assisted development methods are currently aimed at “low hanging fruit” that frees up devs and engineers for more important and creative tasks.</p>



<p>A survey of more than 2,300 developers earlier this year found that 42% are already using what Forrester terms “<a href=""https://www.forrester.com/blogs/generative-ai-turingbots-win-again-in-forrester-top-10-emerging-technologies/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TuringBots</a>,” or AI-based code generators. “The opportunity is too big to ignore,” Guidice wrote in <a href=""https://www.forrester.com/report/the-architects-guide-to-turingbots-2025/RES180787"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">an April report</a>, “The Architect’s Guide to TuringBots.”</p>



<p>“As TuringBots become smarter and more autonomous and enterprises leverage their capabilities beyond just code generation, teams will automate more concatenated software development lifecycle (SDLC) tasks and build end-to-end apps that today take weeks or months to deliver in near real time,” the report states.</p>



<p>AI assistants like GPT-4 Turbo (ChatGPT), GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit Ghostwriter, Codeium and Amazon Q Developer all support vibe coding by enabling intuitive, conversational development.</p>



<p>Augmented coding tools can help brainstorm, prototype, build full features, and check code for errors or security holes using natural language processing — whether through real-time suggestions (Copilot), interactive code editing (Cursor), or full-stack guidance (ChatGPT). The tools streamline coding, making them ideal for solo developers, fast prototyping, or collaborative workflows, according to Gartner.</p>



<p>GenAI tools include prompt-to-application tools such as StackBlitz Bolt.new, Github Spark, and Lovable, as well as AI-augmented testing tools such as BlinqIO, Diffblue, IDERA, QualityKiosk Technologies and Qyrus.</p>



<p>Apple is <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3977439/apple-taps-anthropics-claude-for-ai-app-development.html"">reportedly working with Anthropic</a> to bring AI coding tools to <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1630080/apple-wants-xcode-to-make-you-smarter.html"">Xcode</a>, using the Claude Sonnet model to support AI-generated code writing and testing. The tools are being tested internally, with no confirmed plans for public release, and Apple is unlikely to comment before <a href=""https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">next month’s WWDC</a>.</p>



<p>After a prewview In 2023, AWS launched Q Developer in April 2024. Developers use Amazon Q Developer to vibe code in the <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/introducing-the-enhanced-command-line-interface-in-amazon-q-developer/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">command line interface</a> (CLI), and last week, AWS expanded this agentic experience to the integrated development environments (IDE) for Visual Studio Code so developers can now also <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-q-developer-elevates-the-ide-experience-with-new-agentic-coding-experience/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vibe code in the IDE</a>.</p>



<p>Srini Iragavarapu, director of GenAI Applications and Experiences at AWS, pictures developers with mood lighting and music having a conversation with AWS’s AI tools to create new products and fix code in existing code base. Iragavarapu compared AI-assisted coding to conventional “pair programming,” where two developers work together on the same project.</p>



<p>“It’s a very fluid interaction with the AI systems. Now the paired programmer…is the AI assistant,” he said. “These agents are task based. They are goal seeking, similar to how the programmer sitting next to you is goal seeking in that they would want to finish a task at the end of the day.”</p>



<p>Internally, Amazon developers all have access to the Q Developer tool set. Recently, the company <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-jassy-8b1615_one-of-the-most-tedious-but-critical-tasks-activity-7232374162185461760-AdSz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">used Q Developer</a> to help it update 30,000 applications from an older version of Java to a newer version. AWS believes it saved 4,500 years in software engineering time that it would have otherwise have taken a team of engineers to complete the upgrade, as well as $260 million in annualized efficiency gains, Iragavarapu said.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>A foundational change in the Software Development Life Cycle</strong></h2>



<p>Gartner Research, in a survey published last month, found that 35% of IT leaders expect genAI to fundamentally change their organization, with 52% expecting their organization to  use the technology to build software. More than two-thirds of the execs surveyed also believe genAI benefits outweigh the technology’s risks.</p>



<p>Using genAI in software engineering leads to an increased focus on team productivity due to the widespread perception that the key benefit from the technology will be cost reduction, Gartner said</p>



<p>Armando Franco, director of Technology Modernization at IT consultancy TEKsystems Global Services, agreed most businesses have jumped on the AI train; and, while development jobs will still exist, they will be completely different. </p>



<p>Overall, Franco argued, genAI tools will not be able to generate 90% of the application technology stack; more accurately, that figure could be around 60% to 70% of the application code base. That breaks down into several key areas, such as:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Simple App Code: 60-90%</li>



<li>API & Middleware: 50%</li>



<li>Data Layer: 40%</li>



<li>IaC: 80%</li>



<li>Networking: 25%</li>



<li>Security & Policy: 25%</li>



<li>Operations and Observability: 50%</li>
</ul>



<p>Franco based his numbers on the current capabilities of available genAI tools and what he’s seen through internal development, “and it changes daily and can be very expensive depending on the models used,” he said.</p>



<p>“This will evolve,” Franco said. “For now, genAI can generate most of the basic, common, repeatable patterns. For advanced or complex scenarios, human-guided code development is required. As the platforms evolve, genAI will provide a platform for developers to guide genAI on how to develop more complex features.”</p>



<p>The same holds true for AI agents; developers can use genAI to develop complex agents that can then be deployed and trained on the same platform, he said.</p>



<p>Current AI tools, while powerful, are often costly to use and they change rapidly, Franco said. He described an evolution in software engineering, where engineers become specialized AI-powered architects who design and maintain complex systems with rapid, user-driven updates. Prompt engineering skills will be essential, too, as guiding AI effectively becomes a core skill. </p>



<p>Rather than competing with the technology, engineers will work alongside it in  smaller, expert teams that build faster, higher-quality applications and drive innovation across industries, he said.</p>



<p>Developers find genAI tools most useful for tasks like boilerplate generation, code understanding, testing, documentation, and refactoring. But they also create risks around code quality, IP, bias, and the effort needed to guide and verify outputs, Gartner said in a report last month.</p>



<p>“Software engineers should assess the potential benefits and update fundamental processes to ensure the successful adoption of genAI-augmented development tools,” Matt Brasier, a Gartner vice president analyst, wrote in the report.</p>



<p>Even as developers increasingly rely on AI-augmentation tools, “humans must stay in the loop to understand what code is being deployed and how,” said AWS’s Iragavarapu. “Writing the code and building the application is [just] a lot easier. And in fact, as you’re deploying and debugging…understanding the logic of what it is doing and how it is doing [it] still are very relevant and prevalent.”</p>

<p>Should Apple have abandoned its <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/apple-fights-back-against-state-surveillance-sues-nso-group/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lawsuit against Israeli mercenary spyware vendor NSO Group</a> — the company <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1616128/apple-pulls-no-punches-in-lawsuit-against-amoral-nso-group.html"">it once described</a> as, “21st century mercenaries who have created highly sophisticated cyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant abuse.” Perhaps not, but it’s still heart-warming to learn NSO has been <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3980115/meta-wins-168m-judgment-against-spyware-seller-nso-group.html"">slammed with a huge $168 million fine</a> for spying on WhatsApp.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Mercenaries in your machine</strong></h2>



<p>The NSO is one of the most renowned of a multitude of <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1623259/nso-group-returns-with-triple-ios-1516-zero-click-spyware-attack.html"">surveillance-as-a-service companies</a> exploiting complex and expensive hacks to break into people’s digital devices and spy on them, frequently for oppressive governments.</p>



<p>That the spyware sector is thriving is a grim reflection of our deeply amoral age. Its existence should encourage everyone to invest in more security, rather than demand less, even at the <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3830376/apple-terminates-uk-data-protection-after-government-overreach.html"">encryption-eroding UK Home Office</a>. But, I digress.</p>



<p>NSO Group broke into the mainstream in 2019 when reports emerged showing the extent to which its Pegasus spyware had been used against 1,400 WhatsApp messages in addition to attacks against iPhones. </p>



<p>Pegasus was an insidious attack that, once installed, granted total access to compromised devices. It turned people’s phone records, emails, messages, video content, and location data into open books, and could even be used to activate cameras and microphones to engage in remote surveillance.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Litigation potentially raised the risk</strong></h2>



<p>Both Apple and Facebook began litigation against NSO Group, but Apple withdrew its attempt last year, arguing that continuing in the claim could undermine the systems it has built to secure its ecosystem. “While Apple continues to believe in the merits of its claims, it has also determined that proceeding further with this case has the potential to put vital security information at risk,” it told the court.</p>



<p>WhatsApp continued its case, which it has now won, winning what sounds like a lot: $168 million in compensation. </p>



<p>Since then, NSO Group and others like it have been embroiled in numerous attacks against a huge range of targets, including human rights protectors, opposition parties, dissidents, journalists and others on behalf of a range of governments, including those with very poor human rights records. </p>



<p>That’s not how the company sees itself, of course. “We firmly believe that our technology plays a critical role in preventing serious crime and terrorism and is deployed responsibly by authorized government agencies,” said NSO spokesman Gil Lainer via email. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Is that right?</strong></h2>



<p>Meta claims NSO repeatedly targeted people involved in its case against the company, which undermines the claim to be on the right side of history. The legal defenses it put up in court were equally evasive.</p>



<p>The company delivers attacks that are complex, sophisticated, and cost a lot of money to mount, which means most people don’t need to worry about being attacked this way, while those that do should be using <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/how-to-use-lockdown-mode-on-your-iphone-ipad-and-mac/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple’s Lockdown Mode</a>. These attacks often require no user input whatsoever and can begin with a missed call or an unrequested message. </p>



<p>With many thousands of people seemingly affected by these attacks, and with OS providers shouldering the additional cost of mitigating against such attacks, it’s pretty clear NSO Group will likely see the fine as a small tax on earnings. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>This fine is small change</strong></h2>



<p>The thing is, $168 million may well be peanuts to NSO Group. Six years ago, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The New York Times</a> reported that the market for digital espionage systems of this kind had already reached past $12 billion. Just last year, it was reported the company charged a “standard price” of $7 million for simultaneous access to hack 15 devices. </p>



<p>Targeting individuals outside of national borders cost people $1 million or $2 million dollars a pop. (These exploits were <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1623562/security-researchers-uncover-nso-group-iphone-attacks-in-europe.html"">widely used internationally</a> — even the CIA and FBI used the software, paying more than $7 million for the privilege, before its use was banned.) </p>



<p>But the company wasn’t just generating plenty of money in exchange for undermining digital security for one or two individuals, it’s been implicated in smashing the digital windows belonging to thousands of people. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>No one is safe until everyone is safe</strong></h2>



<p>For enterprise users, the implications are stark. It means that if you or your business is involved in some way with national security or possesses unique business secrets, you can no longer assume your data is at all safe. For as long as companies such as NSO Group exist, your data is just waiting for a competitor to pick up the phone, cough up the cash, and get some mercenary spyware company to break it out. This seems a very sub-optimal reality in digital transformation.</p>



<p>Rather than stopping the company in its tracks, the fine could just cause NSO to raise prices a little, I imagine. The risk remains and is real. And these attacks will trickle down.</p>

28,Google launches a Gemini app for iPad,"<p>Google is once again crossing the great divide between rival tech giants, at least with <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/"">artificial intelligence</a>. The company has launched a dedicated iPad app for its Gemini AI assistant. In addition to natively running on Apple hardware, Gemini's iPad app can take advantage of the tablet's split view, so that the AI assistant is open on the screen at the same time as another program for easier use. The app is available today from the App Store in all countries where Gemini is currently available.</p>
<p>Gemini has been a huge focus for Google's recent announcements as it works to put its service in front of more and more potential users. <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-now-offers-a-standalone-gemini-app-on-iphone-160025513.html""><ins>iPhones</ins></a> got their first native Gemini app last November.

<p>Google could lose a third of its business if the courts force it to relinquish its default search deal for Apple’s Safari. It could lose the same thing if Apple voluntarily switches to AI-driven search services from other parties, including Apple itself.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that Google will be the <a href=""https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-slides-apple-eyes-google-085930527.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">biggest casualty</a> if US courts force it to stop paying Apple roughly $20b a year to be included as the default search engine in Safari. That’s bad news for Apple, but given that Google currently pays Apple <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">36% of search ads revenue</a> generated by searches via the Apple browser, it’s existentially grim news for Google. It’s doubtful a company seeing its revenue savaged in such a way can easily survive — at least, not in its present form. </p>



<p>The outcome for Apple is also grim, though perhaps not quite so existentially challenging. Sure, Apple may find itself short of a hugely damaging $20b it is used to receiving from Google, but it still has options, including the creation of its own search service based on the huge quantity of data it has gathered using its own <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/what-is-applebot-and-what-does-it-do/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Applebot</a> across the years. </p>



<p>This search feature <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3267993/apples-siri-the-only-search-engine-youll-need.html"">already exists</a> inside Spotlight search. Apple also has its own ad sales business, so it’s not at all beyond imagining that the company could claw back some of the lost revenue using its own resources.</p>



<p>It’s just that it probably wouldn’t be as good. </p>



<p>Which leaves it looking for other options. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Thinking outside the box</strong></h2>



<p>Apple SVP Eddy Cue threw feral cats among the Google’s plump little pigeons when he told a US court this week that Apple is looking to <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/apple-may-add-ai-search-as-an-option-svp-eddy-cue-tells-courts/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">add AI search to Safari</a>. The company has already met with third parties who may be able to provide such tools, he said, and while the company didn’t announce anything, he did particularly point to <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Perplexity</a> as a potential running mate.</p>



<p>Cue was trying to persuade the court not to demand that Google put an end to its Apple payments, but the inference was also pretty clear: If Apple isn’t making money with search, don’t expect search to remain the same. Google’s current search competitors won’t be in the running should Apple switch to AI-based search, as they don’t yet produce a search AI worth talking to.</p>



<p>Google almost does. OpenAI already does. And Apple says Perplexity and Anthropic (which may soon <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3977439/apple-taps-anthropics-claude-for-ai-app-development.html"">appear within Xcode</a> in some form) seem promising. </p>



<p>Apple will probably find some way to generate a revenue stream from the provision of AI in search, and while the current in that income stream may not match the torrent of dollars the company attracts from Google’s search traffic, it’s still going to mitigate the problem a little. Cue’s bound to have come up with a plan of some kind — he told the court that thinking about the problem has kept him awake at night, and Cue strikes me as the kind of man who likes to pick up stress, toy with it a little, and turn it into planning.</p>



<p>Of course, Apple doesn’t want to lose its Google income — and Google is working to turn its search service into an AI-driven search service, one devasted ad revenue-deprived web publisher at a time.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Apple has the options here</strong></h2>



<p>Hey, why do you think the AI companies want to <a href=""https://societyofauthors.org/2025/02/25/uk-creative-industries-launch-copyright-fightback-against-global-tech-firms-ai-models/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">erode copyright protection</a>? The future of the creative industries certainly doesn’t seem to rank particularly highly on the AI industry radar.  </p>



<p>Other than unfolding horror as those industries are steadily subsumed and replaced by machine intelligence, Apple is the company with the options here. </p>



<p>Not only does it already have a pile of search data of its own, but it has a strong ecosystem. Even if Eddy Cue can see that we <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3536872/what-if-jony-ive-builds-the-human-interface-for-ai.html"">may not have iPhones</a> in a decade, the company has a proven capacity to reinvent itself. If Google finds itself forced to divest itself of part of its business — search, or even Gemini — don’t be too surprised to see Apple take a slice of what’s left behind. It will not relinquish a $20b opportunity without attempting to claw some of that income back.</p>



<p>It’s the latest salvo in the ongoing war between government and Big Tech. Apple and Google face big problems with regulators who seem keen to <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3968555/brussels-fines-apple-and-meta-500-million-and-200-million-euros-respectively-for-non-compliance-with-the-digital-markets-law.html?utm=hybrid_search"">make an example</a> of the biggest names in tech, even as Apple complains that in some cases, such as in Europe, regulators seem to have <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/apple-to-appeal-e500m-digital-fine-over-eus-silence-in-compliance-talks/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">decided on their approach</a> to the company’s guilt with little positive consultation.</p>



<p>That’s the kind of approach to regulation that can make a trillion-dollar company paranoid, and like any other entity, paranoid creatures fight vicious and hard. Whatever the outcome, Apple’s existential struggles are nowhere near complete, but it’s very, very far from being out of options. It’s a little less clear how resilient Google might be, however — and investor sentiment <a href=""https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-slides-apple-eyes-google-085930527.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">seems to reflect this</a>.</p>

43,Ireland is pitching a law to force big tech companies to vet ads before publication,"<p>Ireland has pitched a law to force tech companies to vet ads before publishing them, <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/29dd8525-d837-4abd-abc6-761c3bd78638""><ins>according to reporting by </ins><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>. This is part of a larger push by the EU Commission to make tech entities responsible for financial fraud that occurs on their platforms. It also comes as President Trump has begun pushing the EU to scale back regulation of <a href=""https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/trump-takes-aim-overseas-extortion-american-tech-companies-eu-us-rift""><ins>big American tech companies</ins></a>.</p>
<p>While a proposal by the EU Commission would indeed put companies on the hook for financial fraud, Ireland’s plan hopes to get ahead of all that. It looks to stop fraudulent ads before they are even published. The Irish finance ministry submitted an amendment to the current EU proposal that would force tech platforms to check the legitimacy of advertisers before posting their ads.</p>

<p>The amendment would also make it so only registered financial service providers could post these types of ads. The Bank of Ireland says that more than 75 percent of losses last year came from investment fraud that were often linked to ads placed on social media. These ads can be posted at any time and, more importantly, taken down at any time. This allows the publishers to avoid legal scrutiny after the damage has been done. Data indicates that online scammers defrauded Europeans out of nearly <a href=""https://www.acamstoday.org/the-european-unions-battle-against-financial-fraud-confronting-the-threats-ahead""><ins>$5 billion in 2022</ins></a><ins>.</ins></p>
<p>&quot;We can’t leave glaringly obvious holes in legislation that are allowing criminals to defraud people of their life savings,&quot; said Regina Doherty, an Irish lawmaker.</p>
<p>Google has declined to discuss this measure, but told <em>FT</em> that it fights &quot;financial fraud in ads through our tools, people and policies.&quot; It is true that it operates a <a href=""https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/7645254?hl=en"">financial services certification program</a> to help combat fraud. Meta has declined to comment. We’ve pinged both companies and will update this post if we hear back.</p>
<p>Around half of EU countries have expressed support for Ireland’s proposed amendment, though there is a hurdle to overcome. The EU Commission already has a provision in the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/eu-agreement-digital-services-act-172049636.html""><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a> that says that tech companies aren’t required to broadly monitor content, though proponents of the Irish initiative have countered that the requirement to vet advertisers could be designed in such a way that conforms with current law.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ireland-is-pitching-a-law-to-force-big-tech-companies-to-vet-ads-before-publication-154946970.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ireland-is-pitching-a-law-to-force-big-tech-companies-to-vet-ads-before-publication-154946970.html?src=rss

52,How to cancel your Netflix subscription,"<p>If you’re suffering from Netflix fatigue and are looking to cancel your subscription, the process is relatively simple. In fact, depending on how you initially signed up for the service, you’ll typically be able to end your membership in just a few steps. It’s also worth noting that Netflix allows you to downgrade or upgrade your plan if you want to keep your account but pay less. This guide covers how to cancel Netflix, how to switch your plan and what to know before doing either.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-how-to-cancel-your-netflix-subscription"">How to cancel your Netflix subscription</h2>
<p>Netflix offers a fairly straightforward cancellation process, but the steps to do so vary slightly depending on how you’re subscribed. If you signed up directly through Netflix, you can cancel via the website or mobile app. However, if you subscribed through a third-party service such as Apple, Google or your cable provider, the process may be slightly different.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><h3 id=""jump-link-cancel-netflix-via-the-web""><strong>Cancel Netflix via the web</strong></h3>
<p>If you signed up through Netflix.com, these are the steps for canceling your subscription from a desktop or mobile browser:</p>
<ol>

<li><p>Tap your profile icon in the top-right corner and select <strong>Account</strong> from the dropdown menu.</p></li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Account</strong> page, locate the <strong>Membership &amp; Billing</strong> section.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Cancel Membership</strong> button.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll be taken to a confirmation page. Click <strong>Finish Cancellation</strong> to complete the process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After cancellation, your account will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. Netflix will store your viewing history and preferences for 10 months in case you decide to return.</p>
<h3 id=""jump-link-how-to-cancel-netflix-via-the-app""><strong>How to cancel Netflix via the app</strong></h3>
<p>You can also cancel your membership using the Netflix app on Android or iOS (the steps for both are the same):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the Netflix app and tap your profile icon in the top-right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Account </strong>from the dropdown menu — this will open a browser window.</p></li>
<li><p>From there, follow the same steps listed in the section above to cancel via the web.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The mobile app simply redirects to the browser-based account page, so the process remains largely the same.</p>
<h3 id=""jump-link-how-to-cancel-netflix-through-a-third-party-service""><strong>How to cancel Netflix through a third-party service</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re billed through a third party, such as Apple, Google, Amazon or a TV provider, the steps will be different. You’ll need to cancel through that provider’s billing system.</p>
<p>To find out who handles your billing:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to your Netflix <strong>Account</strong> page.</p></li>
<li><p>Look under <strong>Membership &amp; Billing</strong>. If you see a message like “Billed through Apple,” you’ll need to cancel through that service.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how to cancel through some of the most common third-party providers:</p>
<h4><strong>Apple (iPhone/iPad)</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone or iPad.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap your name at the top, then tap <strong>Subscriptions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find <strong>Netflix</strong> in the list and tap it.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Google Play</strong></h4>

<li><p>Open the <strong>Google Play Store</strong> app.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap your profile icon in the top-right, then select <strong>Payments &amp; subscriptions &gt; Subscriptions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Netflix</strong>, then tap <strong>Cancel subscription</strong>.</p></li>

<h4><strong>Amazon</strong></h4>

<li><p>Find <strong>Netflix</strong> in your list of subscriptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Manage Subscription</strong>, then select <strong>Cancel Channel</strong> or <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Cable or mobile provider</strong></h4>
<p>If you added Netflix through your cable package (such as Comcast/Xfinity, Verizon or T-Mobile), you’ll need to cancel via their app, website or customer support. Each provider has its own cancellation process, so check your account or contact their customer service for assistance.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-what-happens-after-you-cancel""><strong>What happens after you cancel</strong></h2>
<p>Once you cancel, your Netflix account will remain active until your current billing period ends. You won’t be charged again unless you restart your membership. Netflix retains your profile information, viewing history, My List and settings for 10 months after cancellation. So if you resume your service within that time, you can pick up right where you left off.</p>
<p>If you’re on the <strong>Netflix DVD plan</strong> (only available in the US), you’ll need to cancel it separately from your streaming subscription. You can do this under the <strong>DVD Plan</strong> section on your <strong>Account</strong> page.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-how-to-change-your-netflix-plan""><strong>How to change your Netflix plan</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of canceling completely, you may prefer to switch to a more affordable subscription tier. Netflix offers several plans, each with different features and price points. As of early 2025, the available plans in the US are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Standard with ads ($7.99/month)</strong>: 1080p resolution, ad-supported content, watch on two devices at a time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standard ($17.99/month)</strong>: 1080p, ad-free, two simultaneous streams, option to add extra members</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Premium ($24.99/month)</strong>: 4K UHD + HDR, four simultaneous streams, supports spatial audio and more download devices</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how to change your plan:</p>
<ol>

<li><p>Confirm the change.</p></li>

<p>Plan changes take effect immediately. If you upgrade, you’ll be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of your billing period. If you downgrade, the change will apply at the start of your next billing cycle.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-how-to-delete-your-netflix-account-entirely"">How to delete your Netflix account entirely</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a clean break from Netflix altogether, you can completely delete your account. Doing so will take slightly more time and involves going to your email, so have your inbox open.</p>
<p>1. Go to the <strong>Security</strong> section of your account and select <strong>Delete Account</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Complete the security check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Permanently Delete</strong> from the available options. An email will then be sent to you to confirm your selection.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-additional-things-to-consider""><strong>Additional things to consider</strong></h2>
<p>Before canceling or changing your Netflix subscription, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shared accounts</strong>: If you’re part of someone else’s Netflix plan as an extra member, you won’t be able to cancel the entire subscription (the account holder would need to be the one to do this) — but you can remove yourself from the shared access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download content</strong>: Any downloaded content will become inaccessible once your subscription ends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Account reactivation</strong>: You can restart your membership at any time by signing in and clicking <strong>Restart Membership</strong> from your <strong>Account</strong> page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Billing dates</strong>: Your account page will show your exact billing date. Cancel before this date to avoid being charged for another month.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=""jump-link-faqs""><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<h3 id=""jump-link-can-i-pause-my-netflix-subscription""><strong>Can I pause my Netflix subscription?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, Netflix allows you to pause your membership, but only for one month. During this time, you can still watch your favorite content until the end of the current billing period. You will not be charged for the next billing period, and will be unable to access content while the pause is in effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of your one-month pause, your membership will automatically resume and you will be charged for the next period. You can choose to “Pause for a month” via the “Cancel Membership” option in your Netflix account settings, and can repeat the process two more times (for a total pause period of three months at a time). However, if you prefer to take a longer break from the service, you may be better off cancelling your membership instead.</p>
<h3 id=""jump-link-will-i-get-a-refund-if-i-cancel-early""><strong>Will I get a refund if I cancel early?</strong></h3>
<p>No, Netflix does not offer partial refunds. You’ll retain access until the end of your billing cycle instead.</p>
<h3 id=""jump-link-what-if-i-dont-see-the-cancel-button""><strong>What if I don't see the Cancel button?</strong></h3>
<p>If there’s no <strong>Cancel Membership</strong> button on your account page, you’re likely being billed through a third party. In that case, follow the provider’s cancellation process.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-your-netflix-subscription-202230648.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-cancel-your-netflix-subscription-202230648.html?src=rss

55,"Netflix Debuts Gen AI-Powered Search Tool, Tests Vertical Videos For Mobile","Netflix has officially launched a new AI-powered search feature that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to deliver a conversational content discovery experience, allowing users to describe what they're looking for in natural language. The streaming giant is also getting into short videos with a new vertical feed set to rival Instagram Reels and TikTok. TechCrunch reports: Users can enter their preferences using natural phrases like ""I want something funny and upbeat"" or even more detailed requests, such as ""I want something scary, but not too scary, and maybe a little bit funny, but not haha funny."" The feature is set to roll out this week to iOS users as an opt-in beta. Some subscribers in Australia and New Zealand have already had access to it, as reported by Bloomberg last month. [...] Additionally, at the tech and product event, the company mentioned plans to use generative AI to update title cards in subscribers' preferred languages. Other features revealed on Wednesday include a short-form video feed for mobile users and a redesign of its TV homepage.
 
Netflix's new mobile-only vertical feed allows users to easily scroll through clips of its original titles. Within this feed, users can tap on buttons to watch the entire show or movie immediately, save it to their ""My List,"" or share it with friends. Of note is that the clips are curated from the ""Today's Top Picks for You"" section rather than being chosen from Netflix's entire library. This approach makes it specifically tailored to each user, ultimately encouraging viewers to watch the full shows.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

Without tax credits, prices start at $44,990. The automaker was only previously offering the Long Range All-Wheel Drive version in the country for at least $48,990 without tax credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The updated Model Y retains the old version's proportions, but it has rounder edges and smaller headlights, as well as taillights bookending a redesigned lightbar. It has ambient lighting wrapping around most of the car inside, and it also comes with ventilated seats and a 15.4-inch touchscreen display in the front. Passengers in the backseat have access to a Bluetooth-enabled 8-inch display. The new rear-wheel drive model has an EPA-estimated range of 357 miles on a single charge, 30 miles longer than the all-wheel drive's 327-mile range. They have the same top speed of 125 mph, but the all-wheel drive has a faster acceleration rate and can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds. It will take the rear-wheel drive 5.4 seconds to reach 60 mph.</p>

<p>AI is everywhere right now — but let’s be honest: It’s easy to slap some sort of silly text generation button onto an app and call it “AI.” It’s much more difficult to come up with a truly compelling way this type of technology can <em>actually </em>be helpful.</p>



<p>And once you move away from <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/2505365/ai-powered-apps-that-actually-save-time.html"">web-based AI utilities</a> and start focusing specifically on Android, the pool of commendable candidates only gets smaller.</p>



<p>Don’t despair, though: There <em>are</em> some standout <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1718291/must-have-android-apps-for-business.html"">Android apps</a> that put artificial intelligence to genuinely intelligent use. They range from multipurpose chatbots to tools for smarter note-taking and reminder-making, image analysis and manipulation, and even personal memory enhancement — among other useful tasks.</p>



<p>Just keep in mind that, by its very nature, much of this <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3627484/whats-next-for-generative-ai-in-2025.html"">generative AI technology</a> is still woefully <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3952838/how-enterprise-it-can-protect-itself-from-genai-unreliability.html"">unreliable and inaccurate</a>. You really have to double-check what it tells you, especially when it comes to more info-oriented uses — and/or you have to think carefully about <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3853747/the-secret-to-using-generative-ai-effectively.html"">the best way to interact with it</a> to get the results you need.</p>



<p>But the apps here all have some manner of redeeming value when it comes to professional productivity — particularly if you think carefully about how you’re using them and why. And I’ll try to guide you toward the <em>types </em>of uses that are generally most reliable and beneficial for each specific item.</p>



<p>All of the tools listed here are either free or with a reasonably robust free tier, too, unless otherwise noted.</p>



<p>Shall we?</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><a></a>AI on Android part I: On-demand assistance</h2>



<p>We’ll start with the simplest and most well-known form of AI, in this current incarnation, and that’s the humble and at times hilariously off-kilter chatbot.</p>



<p>Within that arena, the first and most easily accessible option is Google’s own<strong> (1)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.bard&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Gemini</strong></a> Android assistant (which may well be on your device whether you install it or not). Gemini can do all the standard AI chatbot stuff, in terms of answering questions, generating images, and providing general information — with all the standard asterisks, too, that the info it gives you <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3806751/google-amazon-ai.html"">may not always be entirely accurate</a> — but where Gemini really shines is in its ability to help control your device and interact with your data from various Google services.</p>



<p>💡 <strong>Try this: </strong></p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Ask Gemini to read your notifications out loud</li>



<li>Ask it to summarize your recent emails</li>



<li>Activate the Google Workspace integration (by tapping your profile picture in the upper-right corner and then selecting “Apps”) and then ask Gemini questions about your Docs, Drive, Calendar, Keep, or Tasks activity</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, Gemini isn’t the only AI chatbot option you’ve got on Android. OpenAI’s <strong>(2)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>ChatGPT</strong></a> app gives you access to the interface that arguably kickstarted the current AI revolution. Even on its free level, it can be helpful for summarizing long PDFs or documents (via the plus button in its main prompt area), giving you the high points of articles and other pages online (if you send their links into the app via your browser’s regular sharing function), and finding trends within large sets of data (if you share a spreadsheet into the app or upload it using the plus icon).</p>


<div class=""extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined""><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt=""chatgpt response on android"" class=""wp-image-3965330"" height=""994"" src=""https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/android-ai-apps-01-chatgpt.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024"" width=""1024"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><p>The ChatGPT Android app excels as summarizing long documents and identifying trends in large sets of data.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Beyond that, Microsoft’s <strong>(3) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.copilot&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Copilot</strong></a> puts the same ChatGPT brains into a somewhat friendlier interface that includes seamless integration with Microsoft apps and services; <strong>(4)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.perplexity.app.android&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Perplexity</strong></a> positions itself as more of a smart search companion for both general web-based info and your own uploaded documents, with clear citations and explanations; and Anthropic’s <strong>(5)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anthropic.claude&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Claude</strong></a> is particularly skilled at creating code and weighing out different viewpoints to help you consider a complex topic.</p>



<p>Honestly, in this specific area, all of the options have an awful lot in common — and the trickiest part is just figuring out which one you prefer in general or want to use for any given scenario. That’s where <strong>(6)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Kagi</strong></a> can come in handy. At its core, Kagi is <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91268933/google-alternatives-kagi"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">a privacy-centric, quality-focused alternative to Google Search</a>. But beyond basic queries, its <a href=""https://kagi.com/pricing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">$25-a-month Ultimate plan</a> includes access to something called the Kagi Assistant, which lets you access the underlying intelligence from Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI engines in a single streamlined spot and with the added advantage of complete privacy and custom filtering to help refine the results.</p>



<p>And speaking of privacy, the independent<strong> (7) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>PocketPal AI</strong></a> app makes it easy to download different AI models directly onto your device for isolated, secure access.</p>


<div class=""extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined""><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt=""pocketpal app models and settings on android"" class=""wp-image-3965333"" height=""1024"" src=""https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/android-ai-apps-02-pocketpal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1022"" width=""1022"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><p>PocketPal puts powerful AI models right on your device for fully local and highly customizable interactions.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>💡 <strong>Try this:</strong></p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Look in PocketPal’s main three-line menu to find the “Models” section and click the “Download” option to bring a few of the available options onto your device</li>



<li>Create your own custom and completely local “Pal” that’ll take on practically any personality, focus, and style of answering you like</li>



<li>Tap the three-dot menu icon in the app’s upper-right corner while chatting with any model and select the “Generation settings” option to fine-tune all sorts of intricate parameters about how exactly the chatbot works — including how short or long its responses are and how “creative” vs. focused its communication should be</li>
</ul>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><a></a>AI on Android part II: Smarter notes and reminders</h2>



<p>If you’ve got a Google-made Pixel device, Google’s installed-by-default <strong>(8)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Recorder</strong></a> app is an invaluable AI resource. Recorder is hands-down the easiest and most effective way to record speaking — be it your own rambling thoughts or an important conversation — and then get an instant searchable transcription that’s available both on your phone <em>and</em> <a href=""https://recorder.google.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">on the web</a> from any other device where you’re signed in.</p>



<p>For everyone else — or for any Pixel owners who need even more audio-recording oomph — <strong>(9) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aisense.otter&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Otter</strong></a> is an excellent option. Otter similarly records speaking but is designed even more with <em>meetings </em>in mind, thanks to its thoughtful features around summarization, key point highlighting, image integration, and team-wide collaboration. It can also transcribe your own uploaded audio and video files, though that capability and certain other advanced features require <a href=""https://otter.ai/pricing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">a paid subscription</a> (starting at about $100 per user per year).</p>



<p>An independent-developer creation called <strong>(10) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.audiopen.android&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>AudioPen</strong></a>, meanwhile,is less about simply <em>saving </em>your spoken words and more about <em>extracting value </em>out of ’em — basically like a dictation-centric note tool that does all the heavy lifting for you. Just say whatever’s on your mind, and AudioPen will transform your thoughts into clear, concise notes in whatever length and style you like. The service’s free plan is generous and quite usable, though some of the more advanced options do require <a href=""https://audiopen.ai/prime"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">an annual paid subscription</a>.</p>


<div class=""extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined""><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt=""audiopen app on android"" class=""wp-image-3965335"" height=""1024"" src=""https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/android-ai-apps-03-audiopen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1022"" width=""1022"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><p>AudioPen leans on AI to clean up and organize your spoken memos.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>💡 <strong>Try this:</strong></p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Tap the box with an upward-facing arrow icon while viewing any note — as seen in the lower-right corner in the first screenshot above — to share its entire contents to any other app on your device</li>



<li>Tap the gear-shaped settings icon in the app’s upper-right corner — as seen in the second screenshot above — to configure the exact intensity and style of rewriting you prefer (if you’re using AudioPen’s paid version)</li>



<li>Input specific words — like names — into the “Special words” area of that same settings section to ensure they’re always transcribed and spelled correctly (also available only in the paid version)</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to voice <em>phone</em> calls, Google’s Pixel devices are again positioned for success with the fully featured version of the simply named<strong> (11)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Phone by Google</strong></a> app. Among <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1613551/google-pixel-phone-calling-features.html"">other useful capabilities</a>, the Phone app packs a supremely useful Call Notes feature that can summarize key points from any call for you as you’re speaking. It’s thus far available only on the newest flagship-level Pixel 9 devices, but it’s built in and ready to roll on those gadgets without any extra costs or caveats.</p>



<p>Samsung’s <strong>(12) </strong><a href=""https://galaxystore.samsung.com/prepost/000004312796"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Phone</strong></a> app offers a similar sort of system on the latest Galaxy S25 device. And if you’ve got any other Android phone model, you can emulate the same concept <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3488652/google-pixel-9-call-notes-android.html"">with a pinch of creative thinking</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, for the Pixel-palmin’ pals among us, don’t miss out on the<strong> (13)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.pixel.agent&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Pixel Screenshots</strong></a> system built into the latest Pixel 9 flagship phone models. The app’s most prominent feature is its ability to automatically analyze and catalog all of your screenshots, which is fine — but where it <em>really</em> shines is in <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3496909/google-pixel-9-feature.html"">the super-simple on-demand reminder system</a> it adds right into Android’s foundation.</p>



<p>Just capture a screenshot, anywhere and anytime (by pressing your phone’s power and volume-down buttons together), then tap the little bell icon in the confirmation dialogue in the corner of your screen — and you’ll be able to set an instant reminder around whatever you were seeing that’ll pop up at any future date and time you desire.</p>


<div class=""extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined""><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt=""setting a reminder in pixel screenshots app on android"" class=""wp-image-3965332"" height=""1023"" src=""https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/android-ai-apps-04-pixel-screenshots.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024"" width=""1024"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><p>Pixel Screenshots can analyze and organize your screenshots, but its most useful feature is the simple reminder system it adds onto your device.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>No Pixel? No problem. You can <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3807790/pixel-productivity-upgrade-android.html"">emulate the automated screenshot cataloguing piece of the puzzle</a> on <em>any</em> Android device with a clever little creation called <strong>(14)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aculix.pixelshot.app&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>PixelShot</strong></a>, and you can cook up something vaguely similar to the seamless screenshot reminder system with <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3497607"">the right kind of crafty configuring</a>.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><a></a>AI on Android part III: Image analysis and manipulation</h2>



<p>All this AI obsession may be a relatively recent phenomenon, but the long-standing <strong>(15) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.lens&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Google Lens</strong></a> app has been at it for ages already — and it’s <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1635589/google-lens-android.html"">every bit as impressive now</a> as it was when it debuted nearly eight years ago. Lens lets you do everything from analyzing and identifying objects within images to copying text from the real world and then pasting it anywhere you want or even sending it to your computer’s clipboard.</p>



<p>💡 <strong>Try this:</strong></p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Open Lens, aim your phone’s camera at something, and tap the big search button to analyze and identify it</li>



<li>Tap anywhere on the results to select and copy text from inside the image</li>



<li>Point your camera at a QR code or barcode within Lens to have it instantly read and optionally also to open any associated links</li>
</ul>



<p>It may seem obvious, but I’d be remiss not to mention the<strong> (16)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Google Photos</strong></a> Android app as a part of this collection. Photos has all sorts of impressive tools for editing and enhancing images, removing elements from photos, and even analyzing images and allowing you to interact with text inside of them via its integration with the aforementioned Lens technology.</p>


<div class=""extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined""><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt=""working with images in google photos and google lens apps on android"" class=""wp-image-3965337"" height=""1024"" src=""https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/android-ai-apps-05-google-photos.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1018"" width=""1018"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><p>Photos is filled with AI-powered editing tools and intelligent image interaction utilities.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>And finally, <strong>(17) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canva.editor&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Canva</strong></a> is a fantastic all-around option for on-the-go graphic design work — be it creating a quick image for web use or social media sharing, whipping up a flyer to send out to colleagues or clients, or editing existing images to get ’em ready for public posting.</p>



<p>The app’s core features are free, but most of the AI-specific elements — including the ability to add and replace objects, expand existing images, and easily change the style of individual elements — require a $15-a-month or $120-a-year <a href=""https://www.canva.com/pro/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro upgrade</a> (which is also <a href=""https://www.canva.com/pricing/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">available in team-friendly plans</a>).</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><a></a>AI on Android part IV: Text and memory enhancers</h2>



<p>Need a helping hand with your two-thumbed typing? Both <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google’s Gboard keyboard</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft’s SwiftKey Keyboard</a> now boast built-in rewriting features in their respective toolbars, but <strong>(18)</strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grammarly.android.keyboard&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Grammarly</strong></a> takes things up a considerable notch with <a href=""https://theintelligence.com/38432/android-text-editing/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the most advanced and versatile text-enhancing engine</a> available on Android.</p>



<p>Grammarly now works with whatever keyboard you’re already using and pops up a little green “G” button on the side of your screen anytime your keyboard is active. It’ll show you editing suggestions as you go, or you can also highlight any text you’ve entered anywhere and then tap that same button to ask for more specific word wrangling assistance — from general improvements to creating more persuasive or even more confident-sounding prose within the context of what you’ve already started.</p>


<div class=""extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined""><figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img alt=""generative ai powered writing suggestions in grammarly android app"" class=""wp-image-3965331"" height=""1015"" src=""https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/android-ai-apps-06-grammarly.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024"" width=""1024"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><p>Grammarly shows writing suggestions alongside any Android keyboard and can pull up more ambitious rewriting prompts as you’re typing, too.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you tend to have trouble recalling specific details of your online activity, a brilliant little AI app called <strong>(19) </strong><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.mthli.snapseek"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Snapseek</strong></a> is exactly the companion you need. Snapseek works kind of like <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3615775/microsoft-windows-recall-hands-on.html"">Microsoft’s Windows Recall feature</a>, only without as many <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/2128281/microsoft-windows-recall-privacy.html"">privacy worries</a> — as it’s present only if <em>you </em>go out of your way to install it, and it collects activity only within the specific individual apps you authorize. Plus, it stores all data solely on your own device and doesn’t save or share anything with anyone.</p>



<p>When you first set up Snapseek, you’ll have to grant it a series of permissions that are pertinent to its operation. Then, you’ll be able to select which apps you want it to watch.</p>



<p>In the app’s free version, you can pick two. If you pay for a one-time $4 in-app upgrade, that limitation is lifted, and you can select as many apps as you want.</p>



<p>Once that’s done, Snapseek will <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3962080/android-memory.html"">automatically collect screenshots of every action you take</a> and every screen you see within your selected apps. You won’t even notice it running in the moment — nor will its screenshots clutter up your standard Photos or Gallery app — but anytime you want to remember something you did on your device, you can open Snapseek up and search through its history.</p>



<p>The app will show you any screenshots with matching text within ’em for a swift ‘n’ simple recall.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class=""imageCredit"">JR Raphael / Foundry</p></div>



<p>💡 <strong>Try this:</strong></p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Set Snapseek to watch your Android web browser and email or messaging app, then use it to find and reference details about pages you’ve viewed or conversations you’ve had</li>



<li>Look in the app’s settings (via the three-dot menu icon on its main screen) to make the screenshots it saves higher resolution for even more detail</li>



<li>Look in that same settings section to configure how long the app should wait before auto-deleting everything it saves for security</li>
</ul>

77,Minecraft ended virtual reality support today,"<p><em>Minecraft</em> is no longer (<a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.vivecraft.org/"">officially</a>) available on virtual and mixed reality platforms. The change was confirmed in today's <a href=""https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-bedrock-edition-1-21-80""><ins>patch notes</ins></a> for the game's Bedrock edition following an <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/minecraft-is-ending-all-virtual-reality-support-next-spring-212953347.html""><ins>announcement</ins></a> from developer Mojang in October. Those fall patch notes suggested that the platforms would be removed in March, so players who favored VR wound up getting a few extra weeks to fully immerse themselves in their blocky worlds.</p>
<p>Removing entire platforms isn't a choice game devs make lightly. Especially when <em>Minecraft</em>'s player base still numbers in the <a href=""https://www.demandsage.com/minecraft-statistics/""><ins>hundreds of millions</ins></a> at any given time, it seems unlikely that Mojang would take away virtual and mixed reality unless it wouldn't cause a serious disruption for its many fans. There are still plenty of critically received games that make VR ownership worthwhile (<em>Beat Saber</em>, anyone?), but a title as major as <em>Minecraft</em> abandoning the hardware isn't a great look.</p>

79,Alienware just launched a new line of more affordable laptops,"<p>Alienware just dropped a pair of new laptops under its Aurora brand. They are relatively budget-friendly and look like an excellent alternative to the pricier Area 51 line. These are the first Aurora laptops the company has released in nearly two decades, as the brand has <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/alienwares-new-aurora-desktop-can-overclock-to-an-astounding-61ghz-130059365.html""><ins>primarily been reserved for desktops</ins></a>.</p>
<p>There’s the Alienware 16 Aurora and the 16X Aurora. The base 16 laptop starts at just $1,150, which is a good price for a dedicated gaming laptop. The entry-level specs include an Intel 5 Core processor, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU and 8GB of RAM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the laptop can be outfitted with up to the Intel Core 9 processor, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, 32GB of RAM and 2TB of internal storage. All configurations are certified for Dolby Audio and feature the company’s proprietary Cryo-Tech cooling technology. The 16-inch screen offers a 240Hz refresh rate and a 2560 x 1600 resolution.</p>
<figure><img alt=""Alienware cooling system."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/b5ce9760-2a9e-11f0-a77f-491ceca3fa4b"" style=""height: 679px; width: 1193px;"" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Alienware/Dell </div></figure>
<p>The Alienware 16X Aurora laptop line is a bit beefier, as these models all include Intel Core Ultra processors. The max RAM shoots up to 64GB and the max storage extends to 4TB. The GPU options, however, remain the same. The same goes for the overall design. We don’t have pricing on this line just yet.</p>
<p>These new Aurora laptops join Alienware’s <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-revived-its-area-51-laptops-with-serious-performance-and-far-out-designs-040038956.html""><ins>revived Area 51 line</ins></a>.

<p><em>CNN</em> learned of the possible attacks through NOAA emails warning NWS staff that Veterans on Patrol was planning to conduct ""penetration drills on NEXRAD sites to identify weaknesses,"" with the ultimate goal of destroying <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar/next-generation-weather-radar"">NEXRAD.</a> Despite its cooler-than-average name, the NWS uses NEXRAD or ""Next Generation Weather Radar"" for a fairly mundane purpose: detecting precipitation in the atmosphere. NEXRAD plays a vital role in locating thunderstorms and tornados, making it easier to evacuate vulnerable communities before disaster strikes.&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>It's not clear what Veterans on Patrol sees as threatening about radar — the group was previously focused on white nationalism and Pizzagate-style government conspiracies — but concern over the effects of being exposed to radio waves is a common bugbear for conspiracy-types.

<p>An announcement from Intel boasting that it is the first semiconductor firm to achieve “full neural processing unit (NPU) support” in the MLPerf Client v0.6 benchmark released by ML Commons on April 25 generated very different reactions Tuesday from industry analysts.</p>



<p>In a release issued on Monday, the company said that its results in the benchmark indicated that Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processors outpaced AMD Strix Point (the code name for the Ryzen AI 300 Series of processors) and Qualcomm Snapdragon XElite processors, and can “produce output on both the GPU and the NPU much faster than a typical human can read.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-achieves-first-only-full-npu-support-mlperf-client-v0-6-benchmark"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">According to Intel</a>, it “achieved the fastest NPU response time, generating the first word in just 1.09 seconds (first token latency), meaning it begins answering almost immediately after receiving a prompt. It also delivered the highest NPU throughput at 18.55 tokens per second, referring to how quickly the system can generate each additional piece of text, enabling seamless real-time AI interaction.”</p>



<p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, described <a href=""https://mlcommons.org/2025/04/mlperf-client-v0-6/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">MLPerf</a> as “one of the most important AI benchmarks in the industry, and I think this announcement is a clear illustration of Intel’s ISV strength and prowess and how that is helping it address the rapid growth of AI.”</p>



<p>Asked what kinds of applications might use the NPU, and whether benchmark performance even matters, he said, “right now it’s used a lot for video conferencing, noise reduction, and creative workloads. Benchmark performance is becoming increasingly important as more Windows features become AI accelerated and more apps start to take advantage of the NPU.”</p>



<p>On the other hand, Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester Research, said that while the benchmark results are being issued prematurely, since there “isn’t the ‘killer AI app’ that fits this NPU use case,” he can understand why the company “is trying to get wins wherever they can, even if they are temporary.”</p>



<p>The industry as a whole, he said, needs “to figure out what benchmarks are going to be used or should be used for fair comparison. I will at least congratulate [Intel] for starting the conversation, but I am looking forward to the responses of other [chip vendors] before I put much worth into what is being shared.”</p>



<p>Thomas Randall, research lead at Info-Tech Research Group, said, “NPUs in PCs handle lightweight, low-power tasks, such as live captioning, speech-to-text transcription, light adjustment, background blur, and AI assistants providing text drafting and summarizing.”</p>



<p>At this point,  he said, “NPU’s benchmarks are not a big deal because these tasks don’t really push the hardware; in fact, most NPUs are already more than capable.”</p>



<p>Randall added, “as AI-native apps mature and the demand for more performance increases (like how Photoshop increasingly offloads AI to the NPU to free up GPUs and extend battery life), then those benchmarks will become increasingly relevant, especially if on-device private AI (for example, small language models) become commonplace in new device releases.”</p>



<p>As for how fast it actually needs to be, he said, “NPU’s speed matters when it leans into heavier AI workloads. As an example, while little power is needed to blur a background in a video call, image generation pushes the limits of the current NPU’s capabilities. Standardized performance doesn’t matter for most users, especially when increased speed potential would remain underutilized; however, it will matter for developers if they want to scale models with low latency and low power draw.”</p>



<p>According to Randall, because they are purpose-built for AI tasks, NPUs “work great for daily tasks such as speech recognition, background blur during video calls, photo modifications, and even smart capabilities, like Copilot-style assistants. You’ll see NPUs in Apple’s (Neural Engine), Intel’s (AI Boost), and Qualcomm’s (Hexagon).”</p>



<p>Sag added, “the NPU is inherently more efficient at specific workloads that tend to run constantly and can save a lot of power for certain AI workloads. GPUs are good at higher performance workloads that need to be executed quickly but also don’t need to consume too much power.”</p>



<p>GPUs, he said, “use more power than NPUs, but also give you more performance in bursts. That’s why you need a scheduler that knows which AI workloads belong on which core, whether it’s the CPU, GPU, or NPU.”</p>



<p>Having standardized performance, said Sag, “is really about comparing and understanding the difference between different platforms and how they might execute certain AI tasks, so that buyers and consumers have a good idea of what to expect from their <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3975373/what-is-an-ai-pc-the-power-of-artificial-intelligence-locally.html"">AI PC</a>.”</p>



<p>Nguyen said that in terms of benchmarking, he will “tip his hat to Intel and say, ‘thank you for trying to establish a point of comparison. It may not be the right one but at least you are doing something.’ I am interested at this point to see what AMD, what Qualcomm, what Apple will start doing.”</p>



<p><em>Computerworld</em> reached out to both AMD and Qualcomm for comment, and while at press time had not received a response from the latter, the former stated that “AI benchmarks, models, and workloads are evolving at a lightning-fast pace. At AMD, we’re committed to staying ahead of the curve.”</p>



<p>AMD went on to say that it is “optimizing for modern inference workloads powered by efficient runtimes like llama.cpp, enabling deployment of large transformer models such as Llama 70B on both consumer and enterprise-grade CPUs. As part of this effort, the AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series delivers up to 3× faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) performance compared to the Intel Core Ultra 7 288V when running LM Studio.”</p>

98,Switzerland To Hold Referendum on Introducing Electronic ID,"Switzerland will hold a national referendum on the introduction of electronic identity cards after opponents of the legislation secured enough signatures to force a public vote. The Federal Chancellery confirmed Wednesday that 55,344 valid signatures were submitted against the Federal Act on Electronic Identity passed last December. 

The proposed e-ID would enable citizens to apply online for criminal record extracts, driving licenses, and age verification when purchasing alcohol. This marks the second referendum on e-ID implementation, after voters rejected a previous version in 2021. The government has revised its approach, making the new system free, optional, and fully state-operated rather than privately managed. If approved, the e-ID would come into force no earlier than 2026, though the collection effort suggests privacy concerns remain paramount for many Swiss voters.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

115,Meta is reportedly working on facial recognition for its AI glasses,"<p>Diminished tech privacy appears to be another ripple effect from Trump 2.0. <em>The Information</em> <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-renews-work-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-worries-fade"">reported</a> on Wednesday that Meta has changed its tune on facial recognition. After considering but ultimately bailing on the technology for the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html"">first version of its smart glasses</a>, the company is now actively working on wearables that can identify nearby faces. Remember when <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-17-snapchat-spectacles-hands-on.html"">being a ""Glasshole""</a> was considered a faux pas?</p>
<p>According to <em>The Information</em>, Meta has recently discussed adding software to its smart glasses that scans bystanders' faces and identifies people by name. The company has also reportedly considered adding the tech to future <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/metas-next-hardware-project-might-be-ai-infused-headphones-with-cameras-204741102.html"">AI-powered earphones with built-in cameras</a>.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Facial recognition tech would be part of a Meta feature dubbed internally as ""super sensing."" The feature would build on <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-bringing-smart-glasses-live-translation-and-ai-to-more-people-184546291.html"">the glasses' live AI feature</a>, which can only remain active for around half an hour (thanks to its battery). But in future devices, expected in 2026, it could run for hours.</p>
<figure><img alt=""A pair of sunglasses with cameras sitting on a display table."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/d1518330-2b7a-11f0-be67-5fdd7a3e294a"" style=""height: 576px; width: 960px;"" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>
<p><em>The Information</em> says the super-sensing mode wouldn't likely be the default mode for the glasses. The glasses owner would have to opt in. But the person's nearby company — those having their faces scanned and named — wouldn't.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, bystanders might not even know they're being scanned. The current Ray-Ban Meta glasses turn on a light while recording. It's a privacy-focused feature likely spawned from Big Tech's lessons from the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2014-06-27-google-glass-uk-data-protection-compliant.html"">Google Glass social backlash</a>.</p>
<p>But Meta is reportedly questioning whether future glasses should activate the light when the device is ""super-sensing"" them. Uh oh.</p>
<p>Putting on a pair of glasses that gives you AI-powered superhuman memory might sound pretty cool. No need to remember things — just let the AI scan your environment and remind you! But the tech sounds a lot less fun when you think about the poor souls in proximity to one of these, uh, Metaholes.</p>
<figure><img alt=""Smart sunglasses sitting on a blanket next to a case."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/fc74e890-2b7a-11f0-9fcd-08adb6497af7"" style=""height: 640px; width: 960px;"" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure>
<p>Alongside the revival of facial recognition, Meta has updated its privacy policies. In April, the company changed its terms so that its current smart glasses will activate AI by default. The only way to opt out is to deactivate the ""Hey Meta!"" trigger phrase. Adding to the fun is a change that no longer lets glasses owners opt out of allowing the company to store and train on their voice recordings.</p>
<p><em>The Information</em> draws a line from Trump's reelection to Meta's ethically dubious changes. The current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) isn't keen on regulations that slow big businesses' profits. Last month, FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak promised a ""flexible, risk-based approach to privacy enforcement."" The agency has also stopped using labels like ""surveillance advertising.""</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-reportedly-working-on-facial-recognition-for-its-ai-glasses-195502788.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-reportedly-working-on-facial-recognition-for-its-ai-glasses-195502788.html?src=rss

121,Tesla will no longer release the Cybertruck range extender,"<p>Tesla has scrapped its plans to sell a range extender for the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-70000-rwd-cybertruck-arrives-with-some-key-features-removed-120044840.html"">Cybertruck</a>, the automaker has notified customers who have previously paid a $2,000 reservation fee for the $16,000 add-on. Based on copies of the email people have been posting on <a href=""https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1920253628012470621"">social networks</a> and <a href=""https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/range-extender-officially-cancelled.41732/"">forums</a>, Tesla will be refunding their deposits in full. It didn't say why it's no longer planning to sell the accessory, but the emails come a month after the company quietly <a href=""https://electrek.co/2025/04/05/tesla-removes-range-extender-battery-option-cybertruck/"">pulled the option</a> to add it to the vehicle from its website configurator.</p>
<p>The range extender is a battery pack that was supposed to be installed on the bed of the Cybertruck. It was Tesla's answer to releasing vehicles that had shorter ranges than it originally promised. When the company first <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-tesla-unveils-its-cybertruck.html"">unveiled the model</a>, it said different versions would have different ranges, including one that has a 500-mile range. Instead, the long-range Cybertruck, which has the longest range, can only last for 350 miles on a single charge. As <a href=""https://electrek.co/2024/10/21/tesla-delays-cybertrucks-range-extender-reduces-its-range/""><em>Electrek</em></a> noted late last year, the battery pack was supposed to start shipping in early 2025, but Tesla pushed back its release to mid-2025 and also reduced its promised range from 470 miles to 445 miles.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Elon Musk previously said that he expects Tesla <a href=""https://insideevs.com/news/667723/musk-estimates-tesla-could-sell-250000-500000-cybertrucks-yearly/"">to sell between</a> 250,000 to 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. However, a recent <a href=""https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/tesla-recalls-every-single-cybertruck-over-stainless-steel-trims-falling-off/"">recall</a> showed that the automaker sold fewer than 50,000 units over a 15-month period. It's unclear whether the company decided to pull the plug on the range extender because it's not worth manufacturing a new product for a model that's performing far below expectations, or if it has another reason altogether. Either way, the Cybertruck's battery add-on has been cancelled and won't be seeing the light of day.</p>

122,Microsoft raises base Surface prices by 20 percent,"<p>Add Microsoft's Surface lineup to the list of gear that now costs more. <em>XDA</em> first <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-raises-surface-laptop-prices/"">spotted</a> price hikes of around 20 percent for most existing models. The damage applies to the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro lines, as well as power bricks.</p>
<p>The starting prices of the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-7-review-success-at-last-120056125.html"">13.8-inch Surface Laptop</a> and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-copilot-review-the-best-surface-tablet-ever-made-no-thanks-to-ai-160039966.html"">13-inch Surface Pro</a> increased from $1,000 to $1,200. Of course, the new devices <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsoft-unveils-smaller-surfaces-a-12-inch-surface-pro-tablet-and-a-13-inch-surface-laptop-130030983.html"">Microsoft launched on Tuesday</a> stand pat. (And their curiously high prices now make more sense.) Only the 15-inch Surface Laptop was spared, sticking to its original $1,300.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Even accessories like power supplies are part of the fun. The 65W Surface power supply shot up from $90 to $120, and the 127W variant went from $125 to $175.</p>
<p><em>PCMag</em> <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/not-just-xbox-microsoft-raises-the-price-of-its-surface-laptops"">notes</a> that retail partners like Best Buy and Amazon still show the original prices. So, if you were considering a new Surface, that's a good place to start.</p>
<p>The move follows <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/deals/microsoft-just-increased-all-xbox-prices-grab-one-before-the-hikes-go-into-effect-192628921.html"">last week's Xbox price increases</a>. The Xbox Series X is now $80 more expensive, while an Xbox Series X costs an extra $100.</p>

127,Chrome will now use Gemini Nano to catch scams,"<p>Google just announced an upgrade to Chrome’s <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-enhanced-safe-browsing-protections-downloads-extensions-170011035.html"">Enhanced Protection</a> feature. On desktop, the browser now uses Gemini Nano to protect users against remote tech support scams. According to Google, the on-device large language model allows Chrome to protect people against scams the company hasn’t seen before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Gemini Nano] is perfect for this use because of its ability to distill the varied, complex nature of websites, helping us adapt to new scam tactics more quickly,” Google says, adding it hopes to this bring the feature to Android devices soon. The company plans to use this same AI approach against a greater variety of scams in the future as well.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>In the meantime, Android users can look forward to stronger protection against scams that use Chrome notifications as an attack vector. Google is once again turning to machine learning to offer this feature. “When Chrome’s on-device machine learning model flags a notification, you’ll receive a warning with the option to either unsubscribe or view the content that was blocked,” Google explains. “And if you decide the warning was shown incorrectly, you can choose to allow future notifications from that website.”</p>
<p>Fighting scams was a major focus for Google last year. In May, for instance, the company <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-announces-new-scam-detection-tools-that-provide-real-time-alerts-during-phone-calls-181442091.html"">previewed</a> a system for delivering real-time scam alerts during phone calls.

<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>“Search used to be [a] very specific couple of boxes, and the box that really mattered was the box that said, ‘show me a title or a keyword or skill,’ and you basically had to hope that you will find a title or keyword or skill that the system understands,” LinkedIn product manager Rohan Rajiv explains. Now, though, he says, job searchers should be able to just “say what you want and the system will understand you.”</p>
<p>That may sound like a subtle change but it’s a potentially powerful one because it allows people to get much more specific with their queries. Users can still search for roles based on job tiles like “product manager” but LinkedIn will also be able to understand more complex searches like ""business development roles in the video game industry.”</p>
<p>As an extra layer of transparency, LinkedIn will also surface indicators when the company behind a given posting is actively reviewing applications. Premium subscribers will also get access to AI-powered “job coaching,” with the ability to practice interview questions, pitches and other tasks.</p>
<figure><img alt=""LinkedIn will indicate when a hirer is reviewing applications."" src=""https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/0d8f4100-2ad8-11f0-adf3-4573bacf00e7"" style=""height: 1080px; width: 1920px;"" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">LinkedIn</div></figure>
<p>Still, AI-powered tools can only go so far. “The reality is that we have a marketplace where the number of job seekers year-over-year is growing faster than the number of jobs year-over-year,” Rajiv says. And he’s aware that his pleas that job hunters stop applying to as many open roles as possible isn’t the kind of advice many people want to hear, though he stands by it.</p>
<p>“The truth is that volume is not your friend in the job search,” he tells Engadget. “It's only one extra apply, but you multiply that with 500 people, and suddenly the poster has got 500 new applicants that they are going to need to screen. That's only making it worse.”</p>
<p>He does, however, think that LinkedIn can do even more to guide people to the “right” roles. “You can imagine the possibilities of this: for us to say, ‘hey, this job probably [is] not a fit, but based on your skills, let me construct a search that will help you find what you are looking for.’ And I think that that is the future.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/linkedin-wants-you-to-tell-its-ai-about-your-dream-job-133046457.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/linkedin-wants-you-to-tell-its-ai-about-your-dream-job-133046457.html?src=rss

150,Zuckerberg's Grand Vision: Most of Your Friends Will Be AI,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively promoting a future where AI becomes the dominant form of social interaction, claiming that AI friends, therapists, and business agents will soon outnumber human relationships. During a recent media blitz across multiple podcasts and a Stripe conference appearance, Zuckerberg cited statistics suggesting ""the average American has fewer than three friends"" while claiming people desire ""meaningfully more, like 15 friends"" -- positioning AI companions as the solution to this gap. 

The Meta founder's vision extends beyond casual interaction to therapeutic and commercial relationships, with personalized AI that ""has a deep understanding of what's going on in this person's life."" Meta has already deployed its AI across Instagram, Facebook, and Ray-Ban smart glasses, reaching nearly a billion monthly users.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

154,Amazon's newest fulfillment robot has a sense of touch,"<p>Amazon has deployed over 750,000 <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/amazon-says-its-new-ai-powered-robots-reduce-fulfilment-time-by-25-percent-122517342.html"">robots to its fulfillment centers</a> over the last decade or so, but now there's a new, shall we say, more sensitive addition. The company has announced <a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-vulcan-robot-pick-stow-touch"">Vulcan</a>, its first robot with a sense of touch. It's one in a series of <a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/new-amazon-robots-delivery-station"">new robots introduced today</a> at Amazon's Delivering the Future event in Germany.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vulcan uses force feedback sensors to monitor how much it's pushing or holding on to an object and, ideally, not damage it. “In the past, when industrial robots have unexpected contact, they either emergency stop or smash through that contact. They often don’t even know they have hit something because they cannot sense it.” Aaron Parness, Amazon director, applied science, stated in the release. &quot;Vulcan represents a fundamental leap forward in robotics. It's not just seeing the world, it's feeling it, enabling capabilities that were impossible for Amazon robots until now.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Of course, there's an AI component, with Amazon training Vulcan's AI on physical data around touch and force. Vulcan also uses algorithms to determine what it can handle, identify different products and find space in the fulfillment center.  The machine has &quot;tackled thousands&quot; of objects and tasks, like moving electronics and picking up socks. The system can also learn from its mistakes, with Amazon stating the robot will become more capable as time goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon, which has faced continual <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/us-senate-is-the-latest-to-look-into-amazons-warehouse-safety-practices-200029313.html"">reports of endangering worker safety</a>, also claims it's introducing Vulcan for efficiency<em> and</em> worker safety. The robot should focus on inventory in the top rows of storage pods, about eight feet in the air, and just above floor level. Theoretically, this means less time employees need to spend on ladders or crouching down, and more time working with product at their level. Amazon says the robot is already in use in Spokane, Washington and Hamburg, Germany.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-newest-fulfillment-robot-has-a-sense-of-touch-120050449.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-newest-fulfillment-robot-has-a-sense-of-touch-120050449.html?src=rss
155,AI of Dead Arizona Road Rage Victim Addresses Killer In Court,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: Chris Pelkey was killed in a road rage shooting in Chandler, Arizona, in 2021. Three and a half years later, Pelkey appeared in an Arizona court to address his killer. Sort of. ""To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,"" says a video recording of Pelkey. ""In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have, and I still do,"" Pelkey continues, wearing a grey baseball cap and sporting the same thick red and brown beard he wore in life.
 
Pelkey was 37 years old, devoutly religious and an army combat veteran. Horcasitas shot Pelkey at a red light in 2021 after Pelkey exited his vehicle and walked back towards Horcasitas's car. Pelkey's appearance from beyond the grave was made possible by artificial intelligence in what could be the first use of AI to deliver a victim impact statement. Stacey Wales, Pelkey's sister, told local outlet ABC-15 that she had a recurring thought when gathering more than 40 impact statements from Chris's family and friends. ""All I kept coming back to was, what would Chris say?"" Wales said. [...]
 
Wales and her husband fed an AI model videos and audio of Pelkey to try to come up with a rendering that would match the sentiments and thoughts of a still-alive Pelkey, something that Wales compared with a ""Frankenstein of love"" to local outlet Fox 10. Judge Todd Lang responded positively to the AI usage. Lang ultimately sentenced Horcasitas to 10 and a half years in prison on manslaughter charges. ""I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,"" Lang said. ""I feel that that was genuine."" Also in favor was Pelkey's brother John, who said that he felt ""waves of healing"" from seeing his brother's face, and believes that Chris would have forgiven his killer. ""That was the man I knew,"" John said.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

<section class=""wp-block-bigbite-multi-title""><div class=""container""></div></section>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m already tired of all the generative AI (genAI) hype. I’ve been using the technology for a while now, and I’ve found ways it can be helpful — primarily as a search engine replacement — but it’s not everything it’s supposed to be. </p>



<p>This isn’t just cranky, cynical old me. In a recent IBM survey of 2,000 CEOs, Big Blue found that “<a href=""https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-05-06-ibm-study-ceos-double-down-on-ai-while-navigating-enterprise-hurdles"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered expected ROI</a> [Return on Investment] over the last few years.” Further, “just over half (52%) of CEO respondents say their organization is realizing value from generative AI investments beyond cost reduction.”</p>



<p>Adding insult to injury: “64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization, but only 37% say it’s better to be ‘fast and wrong’ than ‘right and slow’ when it comes to technology adoption.” </p>



<p>Really? Yes, I know about moving fast and breaking things, but are CEOs really paid big bucks to make expensive IT moves <em>based on fear of missing out</em>? I could do that, and I’d be willing to accept less money than the average CEO. Win! Win!</p>



<p>Seriously, though, some in the industry have been doing the business math — and they’re finding genAI isn’t delivering on its promises. </p>



<p>For example, Microsoft’s been making <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1629974/m365-copilot-microsofts-generative-ai-tool-explained.html"">Copilot the center of its end-user plans</a>. There’s a teeny-weeny problem with that: users aren’t adopting Copilot. Period. As reported in <a href=""https://www.newcomer.co/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Newcomer</a>,  “At Microsoft’s annual executive huddle last month, the company’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, put up a slide that charted the number of users for its Copilot consumer AI tool over the past year. It was essentially <a href=""https://www.newcomer.co/p/microsofts-big-ai-hire-cant-match"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">a flat line, showing around 20 million weekly users</a>.”</p>



<p>Flatlining, as anyone who’s ever watched a medical show knows, is a bad thing. </p>



<p>Even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella realizes that some things are fundamentally wrong with AI.  He recently acknowledged there’s <a href=""https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/microsofts_nadella_wants_to_see/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">no killer app for AI</a>. And he said this, may I remind you, after pouring more than $10 billion into genAI. Here’s some free advice for you, Satya: Simply adding Copilot features to every last program in the Microsoft portfolio is clearly not the way to profitability. </p>



<p>Even as businesses look to reshape themselves using the technology, they’re grappling with significant hurdles in turning innovation into sustainable profits. Despite soaring investments and rapid revenue growth in some sectors, many genAI businesses struggle with high operational costs and uncertain paths to long-term financial success.</p>



<p>One of the most glaring challenges is the staggering cost of running genAI operations. OpenAI, the leading generative AI company, reportedly spent $9 billion in 2024 to generate about $4 billion in revenue, with the bulk of expenses tied to compute power for training and running AI models. This means, as Ed Zitron, well-known tech maven and cynic, said that <a href=""https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">OpenAI loses money on every paying customer</a>, burning billions annually despite rising subscription numbers.</p>



<p>But what they lose on each one, they’ll make up on volume, right?</p>



<p>OpenAI, by the way, is the most successful genAI startup to date. I wonder what the balance sheets of the lesser firms look like. </p>



<p>True, some smaller genAI companies such as <a href=""https://www.tempus.com/?srsltid=AfmBOop75Lvym2nUUjyzn9xwF8yLxH2Z_RFtClVRO86EDuVSSAPGHa7r"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tempus AI</a>, which applies the technology in precision medicine, <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250506572067/en/Tempus-Reports-First-Quarter-2025-Results"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">show promising financial momentum</a>. It reported a 75% revenue increase year-over-year. Most of the others are still light years from profitability. </p>



<p>What’s the difference? Rather than some vague idea that genAI will magically make everything better, Tempus focuses on a particular business case in which it could improve. There’s a lesson here for anyone who wants to use genAI tools successfully. </p>



<p>Sure, Nvidia is doing great guns, but it’s not selling to businesses or consumers that use genAI. It sells to the companies that want to sell you AI services — there’s a big difference. </p>



<p>So long as startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic raise tens of billions of dollars, Nvidia will be fine. If venture capitalists ever start to wonder whether there’s a profit at the end of the business rainbow (rather than just eternal growth with no discernible business benefit), it will be another story.  </p>

174,ASUS and Microsoft's Xbox-branded handheld appears in leaked FCC photos,"<p>New photos leaked from the FCC appear to <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/its-about-damn-time-microsoft-made-an-xbox-gaming-handheld-130046591.html"">confirm</a> that an Xbox-branded handheld gaming console is coming soon. A listing shows two versions of ASUS's ROG Ally 2 handheld, a dark model with a dedicated Xbox labeled button at the top left and a white version with the same button blacked out. The latter could carry a different function or be removed altogether from the production model, according to the leak (related to Wi-Fi modules) from <a href=""https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked""><em>Videocardz</em></a> seen by <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/news/662440/xbox-handheld-photos-microsoft-asus-rog-ally-2-fcc-listing""><em>The Verge</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The models otherwise look identical but carry different specs, according to other parts of the listing. Both have 7-inch 120Hz displays, but the ROG Ally 2 Xbox version (RC73X1) will come with an AMD 8-Core 36W Ryzen Z2 Extreme and 64GB LPDDR5X memory, while the regular model (RC73YA) will pack an AMD 4-core 20W AMD Aeirth Plus chip (memory unknown). Compared to the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-review-the-steam-decks-most-powerful-rival-specs-price-080029032.html"">ROG Ally</a>, the Rog Ally 2 has a thicker design and more rounded grips. It also offers a pair of USB-C controllers, along with HDMI and 3.5mm connectors, according to the rear view.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>It's not yet known what the Xbox button will do, but Microsoft is expected to add features like support for the Xbox Game Bar, Play Anywhere functionality and Game Pass Ultimate. It could go even deeper, possibly launching the Xbox app on Windows, according to <em>Videocardz</em>. Some peripherals like the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-backbone-one-xbox-edition-controller-is-a-great-way-to-work-through-that-game-pass-library-130031268.html"">Backbone One</a> already carry an Xbox button to open up the Xbox guide, show available games and more.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see more details, but as Engadget's Sam Rutherford put it, &quot;the case for an Xbox handheld seems so obvious it's kind of surprising Microsoft didn't announce one years ago.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-branded-handheld-appears-in-leaked-fcc-photos-123021510.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-branded-handheld-appears-in-leaked-fcc-photos-123021510.html?src=rss

182,Apple files emergency hold to challenge App Store payment injunction,"<p>Apple has <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-asks-us-appeals-court-pause-ruling-epic-games-case-2025-05-08/"">filed an emergency motion</a>, asking a federal appeals court to put a pause on orders that would significantly change how the App Store works. Those changes, the company argued in its motion, will cost the company &quot;substantial sums annually&quot; and are based on conduct that hasn't been &quot;adjudicated to be (and is not) unlawful.&quot; It said those orders were made to punish Apple for &quot;purported non-compliance&quot; to previous orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'll recall, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recently ruled that <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/court-orders-apple-to-stop-collecting-fees-for-purchases-made-outside-the-app-store-110036376.html"">Apple had violated</a> her 2021 ruling on the lawsuit Epic Games filed against Apple. In her original decision, the judge told the company to allow developers to direct users to other payment systems that would let them bypass the 30 percent commission fee Apple collects. But Apple still collected up to a 27 percent cut for external purchases, and it also showed users a &quot;scare screen&quot; warning them that paying outside the App Store would mean they wouldn't have the company's protection.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>In her new ruling, Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to stop collecting fees for external payments immediately. She also prohibited Apple from creating rules that would prevent developers from presenting customers with buttons and links for external payments. Apple <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-allow-external-payment-options-123039994.html"">changed its guidelines</a> to remove prohibitions on buttons and external links that direct customers to non-App Store purchasing mechanisms. However, it also appealed Gonzalez Rogers' decision and is now asking the court to put a stay on those two particular orders while its appeal is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple insisted in its motion that it is unlawful to prevent the company from taking a cut on linked transactions, because the original decision didn't say anything about commissions or pricing. It also argued that it's unlawful to prevent the company from setting conditions for link placement and language as the original injunction didn't say anything about it. That provision violates the First Amendment, Apple said, by forcing it to &quot;accommodate messages it would prefer to exclude.&quot; The company accused the court of punishing it because, in its view, Apple &quot;flouted the court's order.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Without a stay, these extraordinary intrusions into Apple’s business will cause grave irreparable harm. Depriving Apple of control over core features of the App Store is, standing alone, sufficient to warrant a stay,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;The district court acknowledged that compliance will cost Apple 'hundreds of millions to billions' of dollars annually... which Apple can never recoup. Consumers would suffer from the destabilizing effects of the new injunction, while Epic would not be harmed by a stay.&quot;</p>
<p>Epic Games called Apple's motion a &quot;last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.&quot; In addition to the video game developer, other companies are also keen to offer external payments that would allow them to bypass Apple's commission. Spotify, for one, already submitted an update that would let users pay outside the App Store for customers in the US.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>When Gonzalez Rogers handed down her decision, it had revealed that App Store lead Phil Schiller advocated for the company to stop collecting fees on web links back in 2023. However, Apple's former Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri convinced Tim Cook to do the opposite. She said the company's Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, lied under oath and told the court that Apple didn't decide on collecting a 27-percent fee on external purchases until early 2024, whereas the truth was that Apple had already decided on that percentage back in 2023. The judge has referred the case to the US attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate Apple and Roman for possible criminal contempt.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-files-emergency-hold-to-challenge-app-store-payment-injunction-123030879.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-files-emergency-hold-to-challenge-app-store-payment-injunction-123030879.html?src=rss

<p>At the beginning of December 2024, only four of Netflix’s “Interactive Specials” remained, of which <em>Bandersnatch </em>was one. As of today there are only two left. The other is <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. The Reverend</em>, which first debuted back in 2020 and is also being removed imminently.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Netflix’s first interactive effort was 2017’s <em>Puss in Book: Trapped in an Epic Tale</em>, but <em>Bandersnatch</em>, which arrived the following year,<em>&nbsp;</em>was the first to be targeted at an adult audience, and arguably the company’s most successful of these experiments. Set in the UK in the mid-80s, it follows a young programmer who sets out to adapt a dark fantasy novel into a story-driven <a href=""https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/"">video game</a>, before things inevitably take a dark turn. The film featured multiple endings and branching paths based on the decisions you made, and went on to win two Primetime Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>Which probably leaves you wondering why Netflix is getting rid of it.

<p>Nvidia and ServiceNow have created an AI model that can help companies create learning AI agents to automate corporate workloads.</p>



<p>The open-source Apriel model, available generally in the second quarter on HuggingFace, will help create AI agents that can make decisions around IT, human resources and customer-service functions.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>[ Related: </strong><a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3843138/agentic-ai-ongoing-coverage-of-its-impact-on-the-enterprise.html""><strong>Agentic AI – Ongoing news and insights</strong></a><strong> ]</strong></h5>



<p>“If you look at the foundation models, they’re very big, very slow,” Dorit Zilbershot, ServiceNow’s group vice president of AI experiences and innovation, said in an interview. “This is only a 15-billion-parameters model, it’s highly trained on reasoning. We expect the reasoning to be very, very important.</p>



<p>(By contrast, some of the biggest <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html?utm=hybrid_search"">large language models</a> (LLMs) have more than a trillion parameters and are designed to handle general-purpose tasks.)</p>



<p>The Apriel model should provide faster inferencing at lower cost compared to those larger models, Zilbershot said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">[ <strong>Related</strong>: <a href=""https://www.networkworld.com/article/3562856""><strong>More Nvidia news and insights</strong></a><strong> ]</strong></h5>



<p>The model was trained on the open-source Nvidia NeMo LLM, the <a href=""https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">NVIDIA Llama Nemotron Post-Training Dataset</a>, and ServiceNow domain-specific data, the companies said in a joint statement.</p>



<p>AI agents have been closely associated with the concept of “digital labor” and can help workers be more productive and efficient by evaluating and establishing relationships between data in an enterprise. With that understanding, the agents can automate tasks, saving workers time and allowing them to make smarter decisions.</p>



<p>More tools can be attached to the inferencing model. An orchestrator, for instance, can take the role of a “manager” that creates the digital labor based on learnings from Apriel.</p>



<p>“You can think about the orchestrator as the manager that leverages the LLM that can reason and plan and kind of understand which…agents to run when,” Zilbershot said.</p>



<p>Beyond that, there are also tools to establish workflow and surface data to better understand the task at hand and the context to correctly answer questions. The integration of Apriel, the orchestrator and data and workflow tools can yeild a sort of digital CEO for AI agents.</p>



<p>“We look at these three together, the AI the data and actions or the workflows as the key pieces to make AI agents,” Zilbershot said. “It’s where you get that boss mode [for AI agents].”</p>



<p>Agentic AI is still in its early stages with <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3852583/evaluating-ai-agents-early-adopters-outline-practical-challenges.html"">tech leaders remaining cautious about its implementation</a>. Early adopters have highlighted  regulatory and trust concerns, and many customers simply prefer to work with humans over computers.</p>



<p>But ServiceNow and rivals Atlassian and Salesforce are actively integrating AI agents into workflows. Those companies need reasoning models for customers to create and run AI agents. For example, Google’s AI agents run on its Gemini models.</p>



<p>Salesforce CEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYfebo0_Kc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Marc Benioff recently talked about the company’s embrace of AI agents</a>, likening the technology <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3960660/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-ai-agents-will-be-like-iron-mans-jarvis.html"">to Ironman’s Jarvis</a>. And Atlassian is <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3959171/atlassian-gathers-its-apps-into-collections-to-bolster-productivity.html"">creating collections of integrated apps</a> designed to make business processes, collaboration, analysis and execution more efficient.</p>



<p>ServiceNow offers its own LLM — NowLLM — and models that include OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o. The company also offers thousands of AI agents on its platform.</p>



<p>“We had customers go live with our agents less than a week after we went GA. People understand the technology. We built it in a way that it’s fully embedded within ServiceNow,” Zilbershot said. </p>



<p>While AI agents are already driving productivity mostly at the  department level, things will change within a few of months.</p>



<p>“I would predict that within three to six months, we’ll see those cross-functional agents and you’ll see even higher rates of productivity gains,” Zilbershot said.</p>

206,Appeals court once again upholds Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"<p>The Ninth Circuit US Court of Appeals has <a href=""https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/us-appeals-court-affirms-microsoft-activision-merger""><ins>upheld</ins></a> a lower court's ruling that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard did not violate antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission had sued to block the merger of these large gaming brands on claims that the new entity would fall afoul of antitrust laws. In the court's ruling, released today, the FTC failed to prove that Microsoft would have blocked access to popular titles such as <em>Call of Duty</em> on hardware owned by other gaming brands. The appeals court was also unswayed by the FTC's arguments that the deal would have lessened competition in gaming subscription services and cloud streaming.</p>
<p>The issue of platform-exclusive titles was one of the core tenets of the FTC's latest charge against this acquisition. However, the <a href=""https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/05/07/23-15992.pdf""><ins>opinion</ins></a> written by Judge Daniel P. Collins observed that &quot;all major manufacturers have engaged in this practice.&quot; And as Microsoft has been making <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hits-ps5-on-april-17-150021622.html""><ins>more</ins></a> <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/xboxs-hi-fi-rush-is-coming-to-ps5-on-march-19-182218568.html""><ins>and</ins></a> <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/forza-horizon-5-will-be-cruising-onto-the-playstation-5-this-spring-201714287.html""><ins>more</ins></a> of its once-exclusive titles available on new hardware, this may mean that the competition agency will finally accept the deal as done.</p>

207,Mafia: The Old Country arrives on August 8,"<div id=""30079cafd914487c943142f8a2438a5f""></div>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> will be released on August 8 after being revealed at <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-sicilian-prequel-arriving-summer-2025-034422942.html"">last year’s The Game Awards</a>. The title will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam and NVIDIA GeForce Now. Fans of organized crime simulators can preorder the game right now.</p>
<p>This is a prequel to other titles in 2K Games’ Mafia franchise. It’s set in Sicily in the early 1900s and explores the origins of organized crime. This reminds me of the iconic young Vito Corleone scenes from <em>The Godfather Part II</em>, which begin in Sicily in 1901.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is a linear, narrative-driven game with stealth and gunplay mechanics. There’s a new protagonist called Enzo who “has the opportunity to join Don Torrisi's crime family.”</p>
<div id=""7fa3778e671145bcb3d80697a4e48ec5""></div>
<p>As usual with modern releases, there are a couple of versions to choose from. The Standard Edition just includes the base game and costs $50, which is a bargain in <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-headed-to-switch-2-with-24-player-races-and-an-80-price-tag-134117599.html"">today’s gaming landscape</a>. The Deluxe Edition offers a bunch of bonus items, like new weapons and outfits. It also comes with the digital score and a digital art book. This one costs $60.</p>
<p>The Mafia series started in 2002 and offered a serious take on the GTA formula. There have only been three real games in the franchise in all of that time, with <em>Mafia III</em> <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-05-mafia-iii-trailer.html"">being released in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>2K Games has a lot on its plate right now. <em>Borderlands 4</em> <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-up-to-september-12-154958162.html"">comes out on September 12</a> and there’s likely to be a new NBA 2K edition this year. Of course, it’s also helping to publish the long-awaited <em>GTA 6</em>, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/second-gta-6-trailer-sheds-more-light-on-the-story-140452729.html"">which has been delayed until May 26, 2026</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mafia-the-old-country-arrives-on-august-8-150025179.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mafia-the-old-country-arrives-on-august-8-150025179.html?src=rss

214,Wikipedia Legally Challenges UK's 'Flawed' Online Safety Rules,"Wikipedia is taking legal action against the UK's new Online Safety Act regulations it says could threaten the safety of its volunteer editors and their ability to keep harmful content off the site. From a report: The Wikimedia Foundation -- the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia -- is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act. 

Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was ""unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation."" The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last. 

""The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,"" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC. The law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force ""we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming,"" he told the BBC.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

219,The next Battlefield game will launch sometime before April 2026,"<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed that the next <em>Battlefield </em>game will be revealed this summer, ahead of a launch date some time before April 2026. The news was shared in the company’s Q4 and and financial year 2025 <a href=""https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx""><ins>results</ins></a>, published this week.</p>
<p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson called the latest installment in the long-running first-person shooter series a “pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment” and recommitted to a previously announced FY26 release window for the currently untitled game. That means it can’t launch any later than March 2026, when EA's fiscal year ends.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>A launch date before April next year would mean the new <em>Battlefield </em>game will get a bit of room to breathe before the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html""><ins>recently delayed</ins></a> <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is supposed to arrive on May 26, 2026. Like every other publisher on the planet, EA has likely factored <em>GTA 6 </em>into its own upcoming launch plans for a number of titles. <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be""><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins></a>reported earlier this year that Wilson had admitted a willingness to delay games in order to get out of the way of the (unnamed, but heavily implied) competition.</p>
<p>The most recent <em>Battlefield </em>game was 2021’s <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, to which EA has steadily added new content. Back in February, EA launched <a href=""https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/news/this-is-battlefield-labs""><ins>Battlefield Labs</ins></a>, a community testing initiative that allows registered fans to playtest and give feedback on series fundamentals such as combat, destruction, vehicles and map designs.</p>

If you can give the mom in your life a few hours back to do whatever — relaxing, creating, or getting things done— do that. The next best thing is a device that'll help mom make the most of her time. We've rounded up some clever gadgets and useful gear that we've tried out ourselves, so we can confirm they're worthwhile. Our favorite air fryer will save time in the kitchen, a quality style-dryer could make her morning routine more efficient, and one of our favorite smartwatches will literally mark the minutes for her. We also suggest a subscription to <em>The New York Times</em> Games, to help make the most of precious downtime.</p>

242,"Google I/O 2025: What to expect over the next two weeks on Android 16, Android XR and Gemini","<p>In about two weeks, Google's annual developer conference will kick off on <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-kicks-off-on-may-20-212810869.html"">May 20</a>. The event is probably the most important on the company's calendar, offering a glimpse at everything it has been working on over the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging from rumors and information Google has trickled out, I/O 2025 should be one of the more exciting tech keynotes in recent memory. Plus, for the first time, Google has spun out a <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/google-is-giving-android-its-own-showcase-a-week-before-io-160035457.html"">dedicated Android showcase</a> planned a whole week earlier. If you want to know what to expect from the company later this month, read on.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><h2 id=""jump-link-android-16"">Android 16</h2>
<p>In years past, some of my favorite I/O moments involved watching Dave Burke take to the Shoreline stage to talk about the latest updates for Android. But for the past couple of years, Android hasn't had much of a spotlight at Google's annual developer conference. That's about to change, with the company hosting a dedicated showcase that will air a week before I/O proper. Scheduled for May 13, Google says it has &quot;so many things to share&quot; during the Android Show: I/O Edition.</p>
<div id=""9231578b8e19429eba2eff3b193004e4""><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Get a front row seat to The Android Show: I/O Edition 🍿 May 13, 10 AM PT. <br /><br />Meet our team and learn about new experiences coming to Android.   <br /><br />Set a reminder and be the first in the know → <a href=""https://t.co/z8QLNSYkl6"">https://t.co/z8QLNSYkl6</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheAndroidShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TheAndroidShow</a> <a href=""https://t.co/RTzTOwUtFN"">pic.twitter.com/RTzTOwUtFN</a></p>— Android (@Android) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Android/status/1916895244278513984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">April 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>The presentation will feature Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat, who took over for Burke in 2024. As for what to expect from Samat and company, a preview of Android 16 is an obvious bet. Google has already confirmed the new operating system will arrive sometime before the second half of the year. As such, it may even release a stable build of Android 16 that same day. One feature Google could announce for Android 16 is Live Activities-like <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ongoing-notifications-similar-to-apples-live-activities-could-be-coming-to-android-210443338.html"">&quot;Ongoing notifications</a>&quot;. Per <a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-features-3484159/""><em>Android Authority</em></a>, Google could also add a more robust photo picker, with support for cloud storage solutions.</p>
<p>We've also seen lots of hints at an upcoming design change to the platform, reportedly called Material 3 Expressive. The most damning (or credible) indication that this is real is the recent self-leak by Google, which was caught by <a href=""https://9to5google.com/2025/05/05/material-3-expressive-leak/""><em>9to5Google</em></a> and remains archived and visible on the Wayback Machine. This leaked blog post discusses the research behind Material 3 Expressive and how the visual overhaul led to action elements standing out more and greater responsiveness on the users' part. According to the post, &quot;When participants were asked to “Send the email” in the app, their eyes saw the button 4x faster in the expressive design.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the best places to get an idea for what's to come in Android 16 is in its beta version, which has already been available to developers and is <a href=""https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/the-fourth-beta-of-android-16.html"">currently in its fourth iteration</a>. For example, we learned in March that <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/auracast-support-is-coming-to-android-180050425.html"">Android 16 will bring Auracast support</a>, which could make it easier to listen to and switch between multiple Bluetooth devices. This could also enable people to receive Bluetooth audio on hearing aids they have paired with their phones or tablets.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-android-xr"">Android XR</h2>
<p>Remember <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-retires-glass-ar-eyewear-082512062.html"">Google Glass</a>? No, how about <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-google-daydream-view-smartphone-vr-pixel-4.html"">Daydream</a>? Maybe <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-stops-selling-cardboard-vr-goggles-141926732.html"">Cardboard</a>? After sending (at least) three XR projects to the <a href=""https://killedbygoogle.com/"">graveyard</a>, you would think even Google would say enough is enough. Instead, the company is preparing to release Android XR after <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-lays-out-its-vision-for-an-android-xr-ecosystem-160001103.html"">previewing the platform</a> at the end of last year. This time around, the company says the power of its Gemini AI models will make things different. We know Google is working with Samsung on a headset codenamed Project Moohan. Last fall, Samsung <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/samsung-could-launch-its-extended-reality-wearable-device-next-year-123008566.html"">hinted</a> that the device could arrive sometime this year.</p>
<p>Whether Google and Samsung demo Project Moohan at I/O, I imagine the search giant will have more to say about Android XR and the ecosystem partners it has worked to bring to its side for the initiative.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-ai-ai-and-more-ai"">AI, AI and more AI</h2>
<p>If Google felt the need to split off Android into its own showcase, we're likely to get more AI-related announcements at I/O than ever before. The company hasn't provided many hints about what we can expect on that front, but if I had to guess, features like <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/ai-mode-adds-a-dedicated-search-chatbot-to-google-170016310.html"">AI Overviews and AI Mode</a> are likely to get substantive updates. I suspect Google will also have something to say about <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/jarvis-googles-web-browsing-ai-is-now-officially-known-as-project-mariner-191603929.html"">Project Mariner</a>, the web-surfing agent it demoed at I/O 2024. Either way, Google is an AI company now, and every I/O moving forward will reflect that.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-project-astra"">Project Astra</h2>
<p>Speaking of AI, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/googles-project-astra-uses-your-phones-camera-and-ai-to-find-noise-makers-misplaced-items-and-more-172642329.html"">Project Astra</a> was one of the more <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-project-astra-hands-on-full-of-potential-but-its-going-to-be-a-while-235607743.html"">impressive demos</a> Google showed off at I/O 2024. The technology made the most of the latest multi-modal capabilities of Google's Gemini models to offer something we hadn't seen before from the company. It's a voice assistant with advanced image recognition features that allows it to converse about the things it sees. Google envisions Project Astra one day providing a truly useful artificial assistant.</p>
<p>However, after seeing an in-person demo of Astra, the Engadget crew felt the tech needed a lot more work. Given the splash Project Astra made last year, there's a good chance we could get an update on it at I/O 2025.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-wear-os"">Wear OS</h2>
<p>Last year, Wear OS didn't get a mention during the company's main keynote, but Google did preview <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-watch-7-and-ultra-will-get-first-dibs-on-wear-os-5-151009264.html"">Wear OS 5</a> during the developer sessions that followed. The company only began rolling out <a href=""https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5-1"">Wear OS 5.1</a> to Pixel devices in March. Given that, you might expect Google wouldn't have much new to share, but the <a href=""https://x.com/WearOSbyGoogle/status/1917346909590618455"">official Wear OS X account</a> told fans to watch the Android Show for updates.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-notebooklm"">NotebookLM</h2>
<p>Since 2023, Google has offered <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/googles-ai-infused-notebooklm-note-taking-app-is-open-to-everyone-in-the-us-155239999.html"">NotebookLM</a> on desktop. The note-taking app uses machine learning for features like automated summaries. <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/apps/notebooklm-the-acceptable-face-of-google-ai-is-getting-an-app-in-may-182041294.html"">Based on App Store and Google Play listings</a>, the company is getting ready to release a mobile version of the service on the first day of I/O 2025.</p>
<h2 id=""jump-link-everything-else"">Everything else</h2>
<p>Google has a terrible track record when it comes to preventing leaks within its internal ranks, so the likelihood the company could surprise us is low. Still, Google could announce something we don't expect. As always, your best bet is to visit Engadget on May 20 and 21. We'll have all the latest from Google then along with our liveblog and analysis.</p>

248,Apple is considering adding AI search engines to Safari,"<p>AI services like Perplexity or <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/openai-unveils-searchgpt-an-ai-powered-search-engine-195235766.html"">OpenAI's SearchGPT</a> could be search engine options in a future version of Safari, <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/apple-working-to-move-to-ai-search-in-browser-amid-google-fallout?sref=10lNAhZ9&amp;embedded-checkout=true""><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>. The tentative plans were shared by Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, while on the stand for Google's ongoing search antitrust case. Cue was called to testify because of the deal Google and Apple have <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/technology/google-apple-search-spotlight.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share"">to keep Google Search as the default search engine</a> on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Cue claims Apple has discussed a possible Safari-integration with Perplexity, but didn't share any definitive plans during his testimony. It's clear that he believes AI assistants will inevitably supplant traditional search engines, though. ""Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,"" Cue said. ""I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.""</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Whatever AI search Apple ultimately adds likely won't be the default at first, according to Cue, but ""there’s enough money now, enough large players, that I don’t see how it doesn’t happen."" There's some evidence to back up the idea that things are changing, too. <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.theverge.com/news/662725/google-search-safari-ai-apple-eddy-cue-testimony"">According to <em>The Verge</em></a>, Cue shared that the number of Google searches in Safari fell for the first time last month, something ""that has never happened in 22 years."" It's entirely possible those missing searches went to ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>
<p>Google pays Apple $18 billion or more a year to keep Google Search as the default, possibly on top of <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html"">other financial incentives</a>. Cue's threading a very fine needle acknowledging the popularity of AI without suggesting that Google's deals have gotten in the way of other search options growing. Clearly, both companies would like their mutually beneficial relationship to stay the same.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple's also had its own public issues with AI in the last few months. After presenting big plans for how <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/apples-first-attempt-at-ai-is-apple-intelligence-181444846.html"">Apple Intelligence</a> would work in 2024, Apple had to <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html"">delay its updated Siri</a>, the centerpiece of its pitch, until later this year. The company ultimately made the decision to work with third-party AI models because its systems weren't up to snuff. That change could be how conversations about adding AI search engines to Safari came about in the first place.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-considering-adding-ai-search-engines-to-safari-180502229.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-considering-adding-ai-search-engines-to-safari-180502229.html?src=rss

251,Samsung Acquires Masimo's Audio Business For $350 Million,"Harman International, a Samsung subsidiary, announced it is acquiring Masimo's consumer audio division for $350 million in cash. ""The deal is expected to finalized by the end of 2025, though it's still subject to regulatory approvals,"" notes Engadget. From the report: Samsung purchased Harman International back in 2017 for $8 billion, though it allowed the company to operate as an independent subsidiary. Harman's brands include JBL, Harman Kardon, AKG, Mark Levinson, Arcam and Revel. If and when the acquisition pushes through, Masimo's audio brands under Sound United will be added to the list, including Bowers &amp; Wilkins, Denon, Marantz and Polk Audio. [...]
 
As noted by The Verge, Samsung published a press release, where it briefly talked about the history of the brands it's acquiring. It mentioned some of Bowers &amp; Wilkins' most iconic products, such as the Nautilus loudspeaker (pictured above) and its Zeppelin wireless speaker, as well as Denon's history as an early adopter of the CD player. Harman had a 60 percent market share in portable audio devices last year, and the company is looking to maintain that position with this purchase. Samsung also plans to apply the new brands' audio technologies to its smartphones, TVs, wireless earphones, soundbars and other devices in the future.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

<p>After <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3835962/r-i-p-skype-2003-2025.html?utm=hybrid_search"">announcing in February that Skype would be discontinued</a>, Microsoft has officially killed off the once-popular communications platform. Users accessing <a href=""https://www.skype.com/en/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">any of Skype’s services </a>will now be encouraged to use Microsoft Teams instead.</p>



<p>Microsoft originally <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1446662/microsoft-agrees-to-buy-skype-for-8-5-billion.html?utm=hybrid_search"">bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011</a> to replace its own Windows Live Messenger platform. Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennström and Danish Janus Friis.</p>



<p>Skype quickly became known as the communications platform that popularized video calls. But after Microsoft’s purchase, the software slowly but surely lost users as video calls became increasingly available on more platforms.</p>



<p>Microsoft started to merge Skype with Teams in 2017, and the focus on Teams further accelerated when remote working became the norm during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

263,Netflix overhauls its TV app with a fresh UI and responsive recommendations,"<p><a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-subtitles-are-now-available-in-a-dialogue-only-format-173953227.html"">Netflix</a> is giving its TV user interface <a href=""https://about.netflix.com/en/news/unveiling-our-innovative-new-tv-experience"">a major overhaul</a>. Alongside a fresh, cleaner look, you'll see recommendations that adapt to your activity as Netflix tries to better gauge what you might be in the mood to watch. The company plans to roll out the update over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>It seems that the aim here, as has long been a goal for Netflix, is to help you find something you want to watch faster. That way, you won't spend an eternity scrolling through the various options while struggling to figure out what to start streaming.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Netflix originally designed its TV user interface for shows and movies, but it had to evolve to better handle new entertainment offerings, such as live events and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/netflix-starts-testing-game-streaming-on-select-devices-smart-tvs-and-desktop-browsers-175241762.html"">cloud gaming</a>. The company has been working on the new TV experience since last year, according to Eunice Kim, Netflix's chief product officer. &quot;Our redesigned TV home page is simpler, more intuitive and better represents the breadth of entertainment on Netflix today,&quot; Kim said on a call with reporters.&nbsp;</p>
<div id=""451b492a83a049fdaeca05e200c629d4""><div style=""width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;""></div></div>
<p>The new tiles for each show, movie and so on are much larger. Rather than having information about a highlighted title appear at the top of the screen, the redesign brings everything together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each tile includes more at-a-glance contextual details as to why you might want to watch something. It might indicate that a show or movie was recently added, is in Netflix's top 10 list of the most-watched titles, has won awards or is leaving the service soon. Otherwise, Netflix might believe that you'll love the suggestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you move between tiles, the animations will look snappier and more fluid than at present, Kim said. The new UI also makes it easier for Netflix to highlight live events — such as <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html"">Christmas Day NFL games</a>, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-be-the-new-home-of-wwes-flagship-show-monday-night-raw-in-2025-165434172.html"">WWE programming</a> and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/theres-an-appropriately-ridiculous-trailer-for-john-mulaneys-live-netflix-talk-show-182510750.html""><em>Everybody's Live with John Mulaney</em></a> — at the top of the home screen.</p>
<p>The main navigation bar is now at the top of the screen, with tabs including including home, shows, movies, games and My Netflix (where you'll find your &quot;continue watching&quot; row, My List, reminders and so on). The search function, which is where you can still browse through categories, is up there too. Handily, you'll be able to switch to the top navigation bar by simply tapping the back button on your TV remote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you browse, Netflix will adapt its recommendations on the fly. So, if you happen to give <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-teases-squid-games-final-season-035721654.html""><em>Squid Game</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>a double thumbs-up to indicate you love the show, Netflix might on the fly add a row filled with similar titles a little further down the home screen. Trailers you watch and your searches will affect these responsive recommendations too. This all happens behind the scenes in the hope of making everything feel seamless.</p>
<p>Netflix has long integrated factors like viewing habits into personalized suggestions. &quot;What's new about the responsive recommendations is active browsing behavior,&quot; Elizabeth Stone, the company's chief technology officer, said. &quot;It could also include things like time of day, as one example. It may also, over time, include situations where a member's able to give an explicit input in terms of what they're looking for.&quot;</p>
<figure><img alt=""Screenshots of Netflix's generative AI search feature"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/8b6a3a40-2ab4-11f0-becd-6e0eadc361e3"" style=""height: 1053px; width: 1872px;"" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=""photo-credit"">Netflix</div></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, Netflix <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/apps/netflix-is-reportedly-testing-a-search-function-powered-by-openai-190025983.html"">recently started</a> testing a generative AI search feature powered by OpenAI. The idea here is to let you search for titles depending on your mood. So, you might ask for something that's both a little scary and a little funny, but not too much of either (horror comedy is the best film genre after all), and you'll get some relevant suggestions. Some users in Australia and New Zealand were the first to get access to this tool. Netflix is rolling it out to more subscribers starting this week as an opt-in beta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company will also start a global test of a vertical video feature on mobile in the coming weeks. The feed will include clips and trailers, and it will be accessible from a row on the app's home screen. You'll be able to tap to watch the show or movie right away or add it to My List. There's an option to share the clip too. Netflix has tried similar feeds of <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fast-laughs-comedy-clips-tiktok-ios-app-182351543.html"">comedy clips</a> and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/netflix-kids-clips-112219037.html"">snippets from kids shows</a> over the last few years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked if Netflix will follow the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/spotify-breaks-free-from-apples-app-store-fees-170617269.html"">likes of Spotify</a> in allowing signups from its iOS app after Apple was <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-allow-external-payment-options-123039994.html"">forced to change its App Store payment policies</a>, Kim said the company is keeping a close eye on the situation but didn't have any updates to share for now. In the meantime, Netflix will &quot;continue to abide by the App Store policies until we hear more about how to best implement any changes going forward.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-overhauls-its-tv-app-with-a-fresh-ui-and-responsive-recommendations-121511958.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-overhauls-its-tv-app-with-a-fresh-ui-and-responsive-recommendations-121511958.html?src=rss

The industry has increasingly promoted these technologies, as public concern about the environmental and health effects of plastic pollution has grown. Yet the rollout of these technologies has been plagued by problems, according to a new analysis from the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI), a fossil-fuel accountability advocacy group. 

""The companies make it sound like it's pretty great, like it's something we should pursue,"" said Davis Allen, investigative researcher at the CCI and author of the report. ""But they know the problems, the limitations."" The new analysis follows a 2024 CCI report which alleged that plastic producers concealed the problems with traditional recycling, and argued that they could face legal ramifications for doing so. That earlier research was cited in a September lawsuit filed by California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, against ExxonMobil for its role in the plastic pollution crisis. ""The new report focuses on this modern deception with advanced recycling, which has become a real focus for the industry in recent years,"" said Davis.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

316,Meta wins more than $167 million in damages from spyware maker that targeted WhatsApp,"<p>A jury has ruled that the company behind the infamous Pegasus spyware must pay Meta more than $167 million in damages for spreading malware via WhatsApp. The ruling is a major victory for Meta after a years-long legal battle with NSO Group.</p>
<p>Meta sued the NSO Group <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-sues-nso-group.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL2N5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHkvanVkZ2UtZmluZHMtc3B5d2FyZS1tYWtlci1uc28tZ3JvdXAtbGlhYmxlLWZvci1hdHRhY2tzLW9uLXdoYXRzYXBwLXVzZXJzLTE0MDA1NDUyMi5odG1s&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIv2U70l_fjCUiHmG5F65j6ZlHfdGlbDgyiUSDenbienyMvRb5ydhMAF8aTlXFlevWE2hjcktV0vtLcU-yjzEMlRgq7vag00tuvFpvN1jPRv6qcLa8FYgJ_OpRHEPnH3JO_CwgBvEf9KZn_VtNvdajp9h9QT2gb-UHd2sX6phDzO"">in 2019</a> over its Pegasus spyware. Meta said <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/technology/whatsapp-nso-lawsuit.html"">at the time</a> that more than 1,400 people in 20 countries had been targeted, including journalists and human rights activists. The company said that the “highly sophisticated cyber attack” <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://faq.whatsapp.com/1831251587214580"">spread malware</a> via video calls even when the calls went unanswered. Last year, a judge sided with Meta and found the Israeli company had <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/judge-finds-spyware-maker-nso-group-liable-for-attacks-on-whatsapp-users-140054522.html"">violated</a> the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Tuesday’s verdict followed a week-long jury trial to determine just how much NSO should pay in damages to Meta.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>The jury ultimately awarded Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages and $167,254,000 in punitive damages. In <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2025/05/winning-the-fight-against-spyware-merchant-nso/"">a statement</a>, WhatsApp’s VP of Global Communications Carl Woog called the verdict “a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve.”</p>
<p>NSO Group, which describes itself as a “cyber intelligence"" firm, has said that it’s not possible to use Pegasus on US phone numbers. In court, lawyers for the firm argued that WhatsApp wasn’t harmed in any way by Pegasus, <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/meta-seeks-damages-from-israeli-spyware-company-over-whatsapp-hacks/"">according to</a> <em>Courthouse News Service</em>.</p>
<p>In a statement, NSO’s Gil Lainer said the verdict was “another step in a lengthy judicial process” and said it would pursue “further proceedings” or an appeal. “We firmly believe that our technology plays a critical role in preventing serious crime and terrorism and is deployed responsibly by authorized government agencies,” Lainer said. “This perspective, validated by extensive real-world evidence and numerous security operations that have saved many lives, including American lives, was excluded from the jury's consideration in this case.”</p>
<p>WhatsApp’s Woog said Meta knows it has “a long road ahead” to collect damages from NSO. “Ultimately, we would like to make a donation to digital rights organizations that are working to defend people against such attacks around the world,” he said.

<p>Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group must pay almost $168 million in damages for exploiting WhatsApp to deploy its notorious <a href=""https://www.csoonline.com/article/2154092/pegasus-can-target-government-and-military-officials.html"">Pegasus spyware</a> against users worldwide, the jury in a US court said Tuesday.</p>



<p>An eight-person jury granted Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages to cover the costs of addressing the breach, plus an additional $167.25 million in punitive damages intended to discourage similar future actions by NSO, <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16395340/736/whatsapp-inc-v-nso-group-technologies-limited/"">according to a court filing</a> with the US District Court for the Northn District of California.</p>



<p>The jury’s verdict, delivered after less than two days of deliberation, caps a six-year legal battle that has unveiled rare insights into the shadowy world of cyber mercenaries and their government clients.</p>



<p>The case stemmed from NSO Group’s exploitation of a critical vulnerability in WhatsApp’s infrastructure. In May 2019, WhatsApp engineers <a href=""https://faq.whatsapp.com/1831251587214580"">discovered</a> that NSO had developed a <a href=""https://www.csoonline.com/article/572727/zero-click-attacks-explained-and-why-they-are-so-dangerous.html"">zero-click</a>, zero-day attack that could silently install Pegasus spyware through a simple phone call, requiring no action from targets beyond having their devices powered on.</p>



<p>The attack compromised approximately 1,400 WhatsApp accounts before engineers patched the vulnerability.</p>



<p>“Today’s verdict in WhatsApp’s case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,” <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2025/05/winning-the-fight-against-spyware-merchant-nso/"">Meta said in a statement</a>.</p>



<p>NSO spokesman Gil Lainer said the company will appeal the verdict, and said the court had ignored the good that spyware can do.</p>



<p>“We firmly believe that our technology plays a critical role in preventing serious crime and terrorism and is deployed responsibly by authorized government agencies. This perspective, validated by extensive real-world evidence and numerous security operations that have saved many lives, including American lives, was excluded from the jury’s consideration in this case,” he said via email. “We will carefully examine the verdict’s details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""inside-the-surveillance-business-model"">Inside the surveillance business model</h2>



<p>Meta shared a transcript of court proceedings along with its statement, revealing details of NSO Group’s operations and pricing structure. Between 2018 and 2020, the company charged European government customers a “standard price” of $7 million for simultaneous access to hack 15 devices. Customers paid premium fees of $1 million to $2 million to target phones outside their national borders.</p>



<p>“It is a highly sophisticated product,” Meta lawyer Antonio Perez said during the trial, “And it carries a hefty price tag.”</p>



<p>Once installed, Pegasus granted complete access to compromised devices, including phone records, emails, messages, video content, and location data. The spyware could even remotely activate cameras and microphones for clandestine surveillance.</p>



<p>The trial also exposed unexpected connections between NSO and American intelligence. Court records showed that the CIA and FBI collectively paid NSO $7.6 million, with reports suggesting the CIA had financed Djibouti’s purchase of the spyware while the FBI acquired it for testing purposes.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""a-persistent-threat-despite-legal-consequences"">A persistent threat despite legal consequences</h2>



<p>In its post-verdict statement, Meta warned that the threat continues despite their legal victory: “While we stopped the attack vector that exploited our calling system in 2019, Pegasus has had many other spyware installation methods to exploit other companies’ technologies to manipulate people’s devices into downloading malicious code and compromising their phones.”</p>



<p>Most concerning for enterprise security teams was Meta’s revelation in recent court filings that NSO “repeatedly targeted Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ servers, and Plaintiffs’ mobile client even after this litigation was filed.” This persistent behavior prompted Meta to seek a permanent injunction against the company.</p>



<p>NSO Group’s legal defense strategy illustrated the evasive tactics often employed by surveillance vendors. The company initially defaulted by failing to appear in court, claiming its accuser hadn’t properly delivered legal documents. It then accused the company of hypocrisy, alleging executives had approached NSO to use the technology for spying on its own customers.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""enterprise-security-implications"">Enterprise security implications</h2>



<p>For enterprise security leaders, the case highlights the sophisticated threats organizations face from state-sponsored and commercial surveillance tools. Zero-click vulnerabilities like those exploited by NSO can bypass traditional security awareness measures, as they require no phishing links, malicious downloads, or user interaction of any kind.</p>



<p>“The most notorious mercenary spyware currently available is NSO Group’s Pegasus,” John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, which assisted in investigating Pegasus, had <a href=""https://citizenlab.ca/2022/07/john-scott-railton-delivers-testimony-to-house-permanent-select-committee-on-intelligence/"">said</a> during his testimony to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in 2022. “This kind of mercenary spyware is highly sophisticated, invasive, and difficult to detect at scale, even by well-resourced governments.”</p>



<p>The case underscores how heavily used communication platforms can become vectors for highly targeted attacks, even when encrypted. Organizations with sensitive operations or communications should evaluate their security frameworks with these advanced persistent threats in mind.</p>

<p>This particular model made our list of the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html""><ins>best Bluetooth trackers</ins></a>, and this is particularly true for those already tied into the Samsung ecosystem. We love the design. It’s an oblong fob with a big hole for attaching directly to keys and the like. This is something that Apple AirTags don’t offer out of the box, as you need a case for the purposes of attaching.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>
 </p> 
<p>These Samsung trackers are also louder when pinged than the AirTag or the Tile Pro. This makes it a bit easier to find something when the time comes. You can also change the tag’s ringtone or double squeeze it to ring the handset, both things that aren’t possible with AirTags.</p> 
<p>Setup is simple and we came away impressed with how easy it was to locate lost items out in the wild. The companion app, SmartThings Find, offers an intuitive Google Maps-based interface. We found that alerts triggered reliably when we got around three to eight blocks away from the lost item.</p> 
<p>These may be the best trackers for Samsung users, but they are also exclusively tied to the company’s ecosystem. Don’t buy these if you use an iPhone. The finding network isn’t as vast as Google’s Find My Device or Apple’s Find My, but it gets the job done.</p>

322,OpenAI’s new for-profit plan leaves many unanswered questions,"<p>OpenAI has abandoned its controversial restructuring plan. In a dramatic reversal, the company <a href=""https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/"">said Monday</a> it would no longer try to separate control of its for-profit arm from the non-profit board that currently oversees operations. &quot;We made the decision for the nonprofit to retain control of OpenAI after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California,&quot; said Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI.</p>
<p>OpenAI had originally argued its existing structure would not allow its nonprofit to &quot;easily do more than control the for-profit.&quot; It also said it needed more money, a mere two months after securing <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-rakes-in-over-6-billion-in-new-funding-192110908.html"">$6.6 billion in new investment</a>. &quot;We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined,&quot; the company wrote in December. &quot;Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.&quot;</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>OpenAI's previous plan called for the nonprofit to cede absolute control of the for-profit, in return for whatever degree of control came with the amount of stock it was granted through the reorganization process.</p>
<p>This was the controversial part of OpenAI's plan, with many, including former employees, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/labor-and-nonprofit-coalition-calls-on-california-ag-to-stop-openai-from-going-for-profit-212548103.html"">labor and nonprofit groups</a> and even <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musk-asks-court-to-stop-openai-from-becoming-a-for-profit-165051728.html"">Elon Musk</a>, voicing opposition to the proposal. Now, the company says its nonprofit will retain control and become a &quot;big shareholder in the PBC.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is the nonprofit going to maintain control? How will that purpose be advanced?&quot; asks <a href=""https://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/jillhorwitz/"">Jill Horwitz</a>, a visiting professor of law at Northwestern University. &quot;We know from the press that OpenAI plans to appoint all the board members of the operating entity. Will that happen forever? Who will they be? Will it be self-perpetuating? Will the for-profit investors have a say in who those board members are?&quot;</p>
<p>Put another way, OpenAI hasn't said the exact structure that it intends to implement. According to <a href=""https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/michael-dorff"">Professor Michael Dorff</a>, executive director of the Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy at UCLA, the company could adopt one of a few different options.</p>
<p>&quot;If you had one class of stock, one vote per share, they would elect a board. You could just give the nonprofit the majority of the shares, and then they would then elect a majority of the board. They would therefore be in charge, at least for a while,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;More stable governance arrangements could be done by having dual class shares, where the nonprofit would have a class of stock and they would be the only owners of that class of the stock that is either super voting shares, again, giving it a majority, or even better, you can define a class of stock and say it has the right to elect a majority of the board.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, the company hasn't said how it plans to ensure its nonprofit maintains control. The nonprofit may have a &quot;big&quot; stake to start, but there are a few different ways that stake could be diluted. Even if you set aside the idea of an IPO for now, the company could still issue new shares or carry out a stock split. In those scenarios, if OpenAI's non-profit doesn't own special shares, its control of the company would be weakened.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/microsoft-said-to-be-key-holdout-for-openai-restructuring-plan?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NjQ4OTU4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3MDk0MzgyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVlQxSTJEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFODA3NUYyRkZGMjA0NUI2QTlEQzA5M0EyQTdEQTE4NiJ9.xivmjfgFyWRd0jvo4UKCXU8sI6d4wgHyyWG3PLjYUiM&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9""><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Microsoft has yet to sign off on OpenAI's proposal. The company has invested nearly <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-investment-expansion-152302151.html"">$14 billion into OpenAI</a>. Under the terms of its October funding round, OpenAI had two years to transform itself into a for-profit business. If it failed to do so, the $6.6 billion it secured would turn into debt. We don't know for sure, but the question of control is likely front and center in the negotiations between Microsoft and OpenAI, with the company's financial future at stake. Complicating matters is that whatever arrangement the two come to, it needs to be rubber stamped by the state attorneys general of California and Delaware.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to advancing the details of this plan in continued conversation with [the state AGs], Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners,&quot; Altman wrote in his letter.</p>
<p>Parts of OpenAI's previous plan remain unchanged. As before, the company will reorganize its for-profit subsidiary into a <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ai/why-openai-is-trying-to-untangle-its-bespoke-corporate-structure-160028589.html"">public benefit corporation</a>. In doing so, OpenAI still plans to eliminate the current capped profit structure that limits investor returns to 100x, with excess profits reserved for the nonprofit. OpenAI has yet to record a profit; as of last year, the company recorded around <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html"">$5 billion in losses</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler,&quot; wrote OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees shared by the company. &quot;Instead of our current complex capped-profit structure—which made sense when it looked like there might be one dominant AGI effort but doesn't in a world of many great AGI companies—we are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-for-profit-plan-leaves-many-unanswered-questions-193942365.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-for-profit-plan-leaves-many-unanswered-questions-193942365.html?src=rss

328,New PlayStation studio teamLFG is working on a multiplayer action game,"<p>Sony has <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/""><ins>expanded</ins></a> its PlayStation Studios roster with teamLFG, which spun out from Bungie and is working on an ""ambitious"" incubation project. The studio is based in Bellevue, Washington (where Bungie's HQ is), though some team members work remotely elsewhere in the US and Canada. The crew includes a mix of industry newcomers and veterans who have worked on the likes of <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/destiny-2-will-get-a-star-wars-expansion-this-december-220446525.html""><em><ins>Destiny</ins></em></a><em>, Halo, League of Legends, Fortnite </em>and <em>Roblox</em>.</p>
<p>The focus of teamLFG will be on immersive multiplayer games. That's perhaps not too much of a surprise given the veterans' experience and that ""LFG"" stands for ""looking for group,"" a phrase used by players who are seeking teammates for multiplayer games.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Its first project takes place in ""a lighthearted, comedic world set in [a] brand new mythic, science-fantasy universe."" The studio is taking inspiration from platformers, MOBAs, life sims, fighting games and elsewhere for its team-based action title. Since it's an incubation project, the game is likely quite some time away from seeing the light of day.</p>
<p>Bungie went through a restructuring process last summer, which included <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/bungie-is-laying-off-220-employees-200242815.html""><ins>220 people being laid off</ins></a> as it narrowed its focus on <em>Destiny </em>and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-shares-first-looks-at-gameplay-from-its-new-shooter-marathon-alongside-a-release-date-213530509.html""><em><ins>Marathon</ins></em></a>. To that end, the company spun out an incubation project to be housed under Sony's umbrella, which turned out to be this.</p>
<p>The new studio aims to make ""action games that players can learn, play and master for countless hours."" That certainly sounds like a live-service game, an area where Sony hasn't had much luck over the last few years despite <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/sony-ramp-up-ps5-production-113543289.html"">trying to focus</a> on such titles. The company has <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-axes-two-more-live-service-games-130048000.html""><ins>canned</ins></a> several live-service games that were in development, including <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/an_update_on_the_last_of_us_online""><em><ins>The Last of Us Online</ins></em></a>.

330,Trump admin announces plans to shut down the Energy Star program,"<p>The Trump administration has announced plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/05/06/energy-star-program-epa-trump/"">as originally reported by <em>The Washington Post</em></a>. This announcement occurred during an all-hands meeting of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Atmospheric Protection, in which the department was shuttered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Energy Star, this program started all the way back in 1992 under the first Bush administration. This is the department that’s responsible for the iconic yellow stickers on home appliances. The long-standing public-private partnership certifies energy efficient appliances and helps consumers find tax credits for these fixtures.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>Data indicates that the program has helped Americans <a href=""https://www.energystar.gov/about/impacts"">save more than $500 billion in energy costs</a> in the past 33 years. The organization states that the average American saves about $450 per year on energy bills by choosing appliances that have been Energy Star-certified.</p>
<div id=""5d064afcfb064a66a0260f293e101d67""></div>
<p>The EPA hasn’t said when this would go into effect and when consumers would stop seeing Energy Star certifications on home appliances. It’s technically illegal for a presidential administration <a href=""https://www.gao.gov/products/095406"">to end this program without Congress</a>, but the same goes for many of <a href=""https://www.uclawsf.edu/2025/02/28/experts-examine-legal-limits-of-trumps-sweeping-executive-orders/"">Trump’s pronouncements and executive orders</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs,&quot; Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/climate/energy-star-trump"">told <em>CNN</em></a>. &quot;For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. That’s a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-admin-announces-plans-to-shut-down-the-energy-star-program-184846271.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-admin-announces-plans-to-shut-down-the-energy-star-program-184846271.html?src=rss
331,Ghost Students Are Creating an 'Agonizing' Problem For California Colleges,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from SFGATE: When the pandemic upended the world of higher education, Robin Pugh, a professor at City College of San Francisco, began to see one puzzling problem in her online courses: Not everyone was a real student. Of the 40 students enrolled in her popular introduction to real estate course, Pugh said she'd normally drop three to five from her roster who don't start the course or make contact with her at the start of the semester. But during the current spring semester, Pugh said that number more than doubled when she had to cut 11 students. It's a strange new reality that has left her baffled. ""It's really unclear to me, and beyond the scope of my knowledge, how this is really happening,"" she said. ""Is it organized crime? Is it something else? Everybody has lots of theories.""
 
Some of the disengaged students in Pugh's courses are what administrators and cybersecurity experts say are ""ghost students,"" and they've been a growing problem for community colleges, particularly since the shift to online instruction during the pandemic. These ""ghost students"" are artificially intelligent agents or bots that pose as real students in order to steal millions of dollars of financial aid that could otherwise go to actual humans. And as colleges grapple with the problem, Pugh and her colleagues have been tasked with a new and ""frustrating"" task of weeding out these bots and trying to decide who's a real person.
 
The process, she said, takes her focus off teaching the real students. ""I am very intentional about having individualized interaction with all of my students as early as possible,"" Pugh said. ""That included making phone calls to people, sending email messages, just a lot of reaching out individually to find out 'Are you just overwhelmed at work and haven't gotten around to starting the class yet? Or are you not a real person?'"" Financial aid fraud is not new, but it's been on the rise in California's community colleges, Cal Matters reported, with scammers stealing more than $10 million in 2024, more than double the amount in 2023.
Wendy Brill-Wynkoop, the president of the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges and a professor at College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, said the bots have been enrolling in courses since around early 2021.
 
""It's been going on for quite some time,"" she said. ""I think the reason that you're hearing more about it is that it's getting harder and harder to combat or to deal with."" A spokesperson for the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office estimates that 0.21% of the system's financial aid was fraudulently disbursed. However, the office was unable to estimate the percentage of fraudulent attempts attributed to bots.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

333,"IBM CEO: Smaller, domain-specific genAI models are the future","<div id=""remove_no_follow"">
		<div class=""grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"">
					  <div class=""col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"">
						<div class=""article-column__content"">
<section class=""wp-block-bigbite-multi-title""><div class=""container""></div></section>



<p>Only 1% of enterprise data has so far been accessed by generative AI (genAI) models because of a lack of integration and coordination between numerous data centers, cloud services and edge environments, according to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna. And for that to change, smaller, special-purpose genAI models tailored to specific domain tasks such as HR, sales, retail and manufacturing, will needed.</p>



<p>Speaking at <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/events/think"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM’s Think 2025</a> conference in Boston on Tuesday, Krishna laid out his company’s focus for the future: integrating both open-source <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html?utm=hybrid_search"">large language models</a> (LLMs) and <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/1635358/ai-language-models-need-to-shrink-heres-why-smaller-may-be-better.html?utm=hybrid_search"">small language models that can be easily deployed and customized</a> by whatever enterprise is using them.</p>



<p>“Smaller models are incredibly accurate,” Krishna said. “They’re much, much faster. They’re much more cost effective to run. And you can choose to run them where you want. It’s not a substitute for larger [AI] models, it’s an ‘and’ with the larger models you can now tailor … to enterprise needs.”</p>



<p>As well as being <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3529501/smaller-genai-models-for-every-app-might-be-the-future.html?utm=hybrid_search"">simpler to deploy and customize</a>, smaller AI models are as much as 30 times less expensive to run than more conventional LLMs, he said.</p>



<p>Just as the cost of storage and computing have dropped dramatically since the 1990s, AI technology will also become significantly cheaper over time, Krishna said. “As that happens, you can throw [AI] at a lot more problems,” he said. “There’s no law in computer science that says AI must remain expensive and large. That’s the engineering challenge we’re taking on.”</p>



<p>Krishna highlighted IBM’s Granite family of open-source AI models – smaller models with between 3 billion and 20 billion parameters — and how they compare to LLMs such as GPT-4, which has more than 1 trillion parameters. (OpenAI, Meta and other AI model builders are also focused on creating “mini” models of their larger platforms, such as GPT o3 and GPT o4 mini, and Llama 2 and Llama 3, all of which are reported to have 8 billion or fewer parameters.)</p>



<p>IBM’s latest Granite 3.0 models are integrated into its WatsonX platform, the company’s AI and data platform that’s designed to help enterprises build, train, tune, and deploy AI models at scale — especially for specific business applications. Granite 3.0 was introduced last October and is part of IBM’s broader strategy to provide scalable, efficient, and customizable AI solutions for business</p>



<p>“The era of AI experimentation is over,” Krishna said. “Success is going to be defined by integration and business outcomes. That’s what we’re announcing today. With our WatsonX Orchestrate family of products, you can build your own agent in less than five minutes.”</p>



<p>WatsonX Orchestrate also comes with 150 pre-built AI models for various purposes.</p>



<p>To enable AI-embedded networking to connect geographically dispersed data sources, IBM and telecom company Lumen Technologies announced a partnership during Think. The two will focus on creating real-time AI inferencing closer to where data is generated, which should reduce cost and latency and address security barriers as companies scale up genAI adoption.</p>



<p>Lumen CEO Kate Johnson said her company is launching its largest network upgrade and expansion in decades; Lumen’s networks will now run WatsonX at the edge, enabling more secure access to data where it’s being created, overcoming the latency issues that can arise on more traditional networks.</p>



<p>“We bring the power of proximity to companies that are trying to get the most out of their AI,” she said. “Imagine working with your AI models and constantly sending all that data back to the cloud and waiting for it. It’s costly, it’s slow, it’s not nearly as secure. Our combined capabilities with WatsonX at the edge enables real-time inferencing.</p>



<p>“All the edge locations are connected to the fabric,” Johnson said. “It’s ubiquitous and covers all the use cases.”</p>



<p>For example, genAI can be used in clinical settings for real-time diagnostics of patient records. As a patient is examined, that data is fed into a local database, which can be accessed by genAI and combined with historical data from another location – a hospital’s data center.</p>



<p>“That’s game-changing and potentially lifesaving,” Johnson said.</p>



<p>Johnson also illustrated how AI will work at the edge with a lights-out manufacturing facility, run almost completely by robotics and generating terabytes of data in order to run.</p>



<p>“Every millisecond matters. What we’re seeing is factories are looking for proximity data centers, from networking to power and cooling, and our combined solution gives them something pretty powerful right out of the box,” she said.</p>

364,Apple Asks Court To Halt App Store Rule Changes While It Appeals,"Apple asked a judge to halt an order forcing it to give up control over App Store payments while it appeals the decision. From a report: In a filing on Wednesday, Apple says the order contains ""extraordinary intrusions"" that could result in ""grave irreparable harm"" to the company. Last week, California District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple was in ""willful violation"" of a 2021 injunction issued as part of the Epic Games v. Apple case. 

As a result, the judge ordered Apple to stop collecting an up to 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store, and said the company can no longer restrict how developers point users toward external purchases.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

The deal is expected to finalized by the end of 2025, though it's still subject to regulatory approvals. Samsung <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-10-samsung-completes-its-biggest-acquisition-ever.html"">purchased Harman International</a> back in 2017 for $8 billion, though it allowed the company to operate as an independent subsidiary. Harman's brands include JBL, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-harman-kardon-fly-wireless-headphones.html"">Harman Kardon</a>, AKG, Mark Levinson, Arcam and Revel. If and when the acquisition pushes through, Masimo's audio brands under Sound United will be added to the list, including <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-pi8-review-excellent-sound-comes-at-a-high-price-160032718.html"">Bowers &amp; Wilkins</a>, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/denons-latest-wireless-subwoofer-works-with-its-soundbar-550-and-wireless-speakers-055521736.html"">Denon</a>, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/denon-marantz-avr-8k-120-4k-hdmi-2-1-034644796.html"">Marantz</a> and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/polk-audio-magnifi-mini-ax-soundbar-specs-price-090043733.html"">Polk Audio</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unclear if the purchase will lead to layoffs, but it sounds like Harman is taking on Sound United's employees. &quot;Built on a shared legacy of innovation and excellence in audio technology, this combined family of brands, together with the talented employees of both companies, will deliver complementary audio products, strengthen our value proposition and offer more choices to consumers,&quot; said Dave Rogers, the President of Harman's Lifestyle division.&nbsp;</p>

Harman had a 60 percent market share in portable audio devices last year, and the company is looking to maintain that position with this purchase. &quot;By combining the audio business of Masimo, which is being acquired this time, with Harman’s lifestyle business division, the company plans to solidify its global No. 1 position in the consumer audio market,&quot; Samsung said. Samsung also plans to apply the new brands' audio technologies to its smartphones, TVs, wireless earphones, soundbars and other devices in the future.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/samsung-is-paying-350-million-for-audio-brands-bowers--wilkins-denon-marantz-and-polk-131514754.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/audio/samsung-is-paying-350-million-for-audio-brands-bowers--wilkins-denon-marantz-and-polk-131514754.html?src=rss

<p>In case you skipped the memo, India is engaged in a widespread <a href=""https://www.investindia.gov.in/blogs/digital-india-revolutionising-tech-landscape#:~:text=The%20foundation%20of%20India's%20digital,%2D22%20to%202025%2D26."" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">digital transformation</a> across the country and its economy — and <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3971013/apple-plans-to-make-all-us-iphones-in-india-by-end-of-2026.html"">Apple’s investments locally</a> are examples of this broad change.</p>



<p>It’s reasonably evident if you stop to consider what’s going on. Apple and its supply chain are investing billions in creating new manufacturing centers across India, and those investments drive further spending on <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/apple-is-changing-manufacturing-and-transport-infrastructure-in-india/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">infrastructure</a> – roads, accommodation, and growth in service industries feeding them all. It means longer runways, better airports, improved property construction, more modern city management infrastructure, banking, rail, and more. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Build them up…</strong></h2>



<p>One good illustration is the <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/apple-foxconn-and-the-impact-on-devanahalli-north-of-bengaluru/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">story emerging around Foxconn’s new iPhone manufacturing city in Devenahalli</a>, north of Bengaluru, India. The $2.5 billion factory, set to be Foxconn’s second-largest outside China, will occupy the space of 220 football fields and create 40,000 jobs. National and state investment to support of the project is being seen in property construction and infrastructure. Regional property prices are rising rapidly as a result.</p>



<p>These investments support a consumer electronics manufacturing industry racing to set itself up in the country. They all drive jobs, of course, though it’s important to note that if the same investments took place in so-called developed economies, the cost of those investments would be cripplingly high, and the skills required would be absent. </p>



<p>Foxconn’s investment isn’t unique. India’s huge <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/tata-group-about-to-make-iphones-in-india-for-global-markets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tata Group</a> is also investing in the Apple supply chain, component suppliers are building out their presence there, and just this week we learned AirPods supplier Jabil is also <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/apple-supplier-jabil-eyeing-more-airpods-casing-from-india-plants/articleshow/120908979.cms"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">preparing to build a second factory in India’s Tamil Nadu region</a> as AirPods manufacturing begins there. (Apple currently makes Macs and iPads in Vietnam as well as in China).</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Apple to make <em>all</em> its iPhones in India?</strong></h2>



<p>The other side of all this investment is digital. </p>



<p>When it comes to fixed broadband, India is one of those nations that had weaknesses in coverage, but this is changing as network infrastructure is deployed. The scale is significant. Speaking at a <a href=""https://bharat-telecom.com/96/website/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bharat Telecom event</a>, India’s Union Minister for Communications and Development of North Eastern Region, Jyotiraditya Scindia, <a href=""https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2127228"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">described the rapid scale of deployment</a>: In just 22 months, we connected 99% of our villages with 5G and brought 82% of our population onto the network, deploying 470,000 towers — this is not evolution; it is a telecom revolution,” he said. </p>



<p>“This is not evolution; it is a telecom revolution,” <a href=""https://ddnews.gov.in/en/global-giants-like-apple-see-economic-sense-in-investing-in-india-scindia/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scindia said</a>. </p>



<p>Apple fans will be interested in something else he claimed: “Apple has decided to source and produce all its mobile phones in India in the coming years,” he said. </p>



<p>Recent speculation has been that Apple will make all its iPhones <em>for the US market</em> in India; this is the first time we’ve heard that it might make all the iPhones it sells worldwide there.</p>



<p>Given that China is Apple’s second-largest market, I’m inclined to think the company hopes to continue production there to serve Chinese consumers, while opening up a third front for manufacturing in Brazil in the coming months; that would keep it from becoming completely reliant on one nation for its iPhone supply chain.</p>



<p>All the same, it’s not impossible that having invested so deeply in nurturing its business in India Apple has now decided to increase iPhone manufacturing there beyond current expectations. Time will tell. </p>



<p>Apple isn’t the only company taking a position in India. Many <a href=""https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-as-an-emerging-global-manufacturing-hub-32736.html/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">other electronics firms</a> are working to build up their business, too, like Apple, also hoping to mitigate some of the damaging effects of US tariffs on international trade. They recognize, as so many do, that unless US consumers still enjoy access to affordable consumer goods, inflation, shortages, and unemployment loom. All the same, the migration to new production centers will take time, given the degree of investment required. </p>



<p>Apple, for example, has spent almost a decade building toward this transition.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>The network opportunity</strong></h2>



<p>The flipside to all of this activity is that national infrastructure is being improved, which opens opportunities beyond manufacturing. Services, Apple’s other strong business, also seem set to benefit from the investments in network connectivity. Can more focus on Apple TV in India be far behind?</p>



<p>A survey commissioned by Amazon <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/streaming-trends-in-india-how-audiences-prefer-to-watch-movies-and-shows/articleshow/106966565.cms"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">revealed a strong appetite for movie and TV streaming in India</a>, a need that can now be met by more people in more regions of the country thanks to the expansion of network infrastructure. That’s driving rapid growth in India’s app economy, according to Apple.</p>



<p>Developers in India generated around $5 billion in sales last year, the company said. “The App Store has been an economic miracle for developers in India and all around the world, and we’re thrilled to support their work,” <a href=""https://www.applemust.com/apples-app-economy-is-also-booming-in-india/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">said Apple CEO Tim Cook</a>.</p>



<p>So, what am I saying? Only that when considering Apple’s business in India, it’s important to put it into context, and once you do so it’s hard to ignore that the confluence of different forces required to support Apple’s investment means smaller enterprises can perhaps identify their own opportunities now, thanks to India’s investments in physical and digital infrastructure. While other markets get closed down, it looks as if India is open to business – though it remains to be seen the extent to which India’s emerging economic miracle will come at the cost of one of its closest neighbors, <a href=""https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/04/how-china-india-relations-will-shape-asia-and-global-order"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">China</a>.</p>

<p>
 </p> 
<p>There are some front-facing USB-C ports, which is always handy with a desktop, and support for up to three external displays. Even the entry-level version offers 16GB of RAM, which is great. The chip is faster than ever, making this an extremely budget-friendly way to get in on the Apple Silicon party.</p> 
<p>There are a few more USB-C ports on the back, which is useful, but this unit offers no USB-A ports. The 256GB of storage offered by the base model could get a bit tight, but it's certainly doable for more casual users. Plus, those ports are always available for an external SSD.</p> 
<p>One curious design choice here is that the power button is along the bottom of the rear end. This can lead to some awkward movements when trying to turn it on, as it basically has to be tipped over. Otherwise, this is a great device.</p>

424,Destiny 2 will get a Star Wars expansion this December,"<div id=""9d79b7372f4b4a419230be8b8f092f96""></div>
<p>Bungie laid out its <a class=""no-affiliate-link"" href=""https://www.destinythegame.com/en/YearOfProphecy""><ins>plans</ins></a> for the next year of <em>Destiny 2</em> content, and the back half of 2025 could be particularly exciting for Star Wars fans. The studio teased an expansion titled <em>Renegades</em> that draws inspiration from the sci-fi universe. <em>Destiny</em> has always featured classic space opera themes about battles between the light and the darkness, so maybe it was inevitable that the game would one day pay homage to Star Wars.</p>
<p>If you fear that there will suddenly be Skywalkers and Fetts running around your game a la <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em>, that does seem like a possibility. The teaser video features a guardian wielding an iconic green light saber, and there are some recognizable nods to the Imperial alarm sounds and uniforms in a few close-up shots. And if you really want to embrace the dark side, the most expensive pre-order option for this year's content includes armor ornaments that can turn your guardian into Darth Vader, Kylo Ren or General Grievous.</p>

433,Ford will raise Mustang Mach-E prices in part due to tariffs,"<p>It’s earnings season, and automakers are warning investors about the impact tariffs will have on vehicle pricing. As <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-hikes-prices-mexico-produced-models-citing-tariffs-2025-05-07/""><ins>first reported by </ins><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the cost of Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Ford’s electric SUV, could rise by as much as $2,000 on some models.</p>
<p>Ford manufactures the Mach-E as well as other non-electric models in Mexico, which are now tariffed when sold in the United States. Aside from the Mach-E, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-pulls-guidance-warns-it-will-take-15-billion-hit-trumps-tariffs-2025-05-05/""><ins>Ford estimates </ins></a>that it will take a $1.5 billion hit from current tariff policy.</p>
<span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span><p>The Trump administration has long insisted that tariffs are not paid for by the American consumer, and while the company made clear it was absorbing some of the increased cost, it could not absorb all of it.A Ford spokesperson told <em>Reuters</em>  that the price increase is partly due to typical mid-year repricing &quot;combined with some tariffs we are facing. We have not passed on the full cost of tariffs to our customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the administration's partial <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/transportation/trump-temporarily-eases-car-tariffs-following-automaker-complaints-130011086.html""><ins>acquiescence to automakers last week</ins></a> in softening the blow on auto tariffs, EV makers Rivian and Lucid<a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/rivian-slashes-annual-deliveries-forecast-us-tariffs-seen-hitting-demand-2025-05-06/""> <ins>have said</ins></a> higher costs are coming. Rivian’s CEO shared that he expects vehicle pricing to rise by &quot;a couple of thousand dollars,&quot; while Lucid’s interim CEO said the company was expecting an 8 to 15 percent increase in overall costs due to tariffs.</p>
<p>While EVs have not specifically been the target of these tariffs, this administration has been unusually hostile towards them, and has worked to reverse government-funded EV initiatives, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trump-administration-stops-nationwide-ev-charging-program-172002768.html""><ins>like subsidized expansions to charging infrastructure</ins></a>. Making matters worse, Speaker of the House Brian Johnson all but <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/us-house-is-likely-to-kill-ev-tax-credit-speaker-johnson-says?embedded-checkout=true""><ins>confirmed to </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> recently that Congress is likely to end the EV tax credit saying, “I think there is a better chance we kill it than save it, but we’ll see how it comes out.”</p>
<p>It’s been posited by <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5342456/tariffs-tesla-imports-musk-trump""><ins>industry analysts</ins></a> that Tesla may have the least to lose (and could perhaps even gain) from the current administration's anti-EV stance, with <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-says-any-trump-move-against-ev-support-would-hurt-competitors-more-than-2024-07-24/""><ins>Elon Musk even saying as such</ins></a>. This is in part due to the outsized effect tariffs will have on competing EV manufacturers like Ford, while Tesla’s substantial domestic production <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/03/27/tesla-wins-detroit-bleeds-why-elon-musks-tesla-is-less-impacted-by-auto-tariffs-than-peers/""><ins>keeps the company mostly insulated</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-will-raise-mustang-mach-e-prices-in-part-due-to-tariffs-164323546.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ford-will-raise-mustang-mach-e-prices-in-part-due-to-tariffs-164323546.html?src=rss

<p>For the most part, the features you want from a set of “Android earbuds” are the same as what you want from any headphones. Pleasing sound quality, a comfortable fit and sufficient battery life are still the foundations. Adequate water resistance is good for workouts, and nobody wants a crummy mic for making calls. Once you approach the $100 range, features like active noise cancellation (ANC), wireless charging, an ambient sound mode (which lets you better hear outside noise without turning off your music) and multipoint connectivity (the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously) should be expected.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>For Android devices specifically, there are a few extras to consider. A dedicated app that makes it easy to switch sound modes, customize the audio profile, locate your earbuds if they ever get misplaced or adjust other settings is strongly preferred. Features like <a href=""https://www.androidpolice.com/what-is-google-fast-pair/"">Google Fast Pair</a> or NFC-based pairing, which can help you avoid having to dig through your Bluetooth menu to connect your earbuds for the first time, are also nice perks. Some Android devices can also utilize higher-quality <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/from-mono-to-mainstream-20-years-of-bluetooth-audio-153031600.html"">Bluetooth codecs</a> such as <a href=""https://www.aptx.com/aptx-adaptive"">aptX Adaptive</a> or Sony’s <a href=""https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/"">LDAC</a> — these aren’t nearly as important to audio quality as the actual architecture of your earbuds, but they can help wring out a little more detail if the buds are capable enough and you’re streaming lossless files. AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming.</p> 
<p>Diversity is Android’s greatest strength, but it also means that some wireless earbuds play nicer with certain devices, typically those made by the same company. Recent Samsung earbuds, for instance, come with a few perks that are only available if you use a Galaxy phone. We have a couple of recommendations related to this idea above.</p>

<p>The best way to test earbuds is simply to wear them as much as possible, so that’s what we do. We typically do this over a one- to two-week period, though embargo times occasionally force us to finish our review process a bit faster. We listen to a test playlist that includes several musical genres and podcasts, paying close attention to how each pair approaches the bass, mid and treble frequencies to get an accurate sense of its sound profile. We also test at high and low volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. We do not have access to a <a href=""https://www.grasacoustics.com/products/head-torso-simulators-kemar"">dummy head</a> to take more objective measurements, but we’ll sometimes look to sites like <a href=""https://www.rtings.com/headphones""><em>Rtings</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.soundguys.com/""><em>SoundGuys</em></a> and others that do just to ensure our impressions are not wildly off-base. If a model supports custom EQ, we’ll tinker with that and use the available EQ presets to see if one sounds dramatically better than the others — though in general we base most of our impressions on the stock tuning each pair uses by default.</p> 
<p>To assess microphone quality, we record our own audio samples and take multiple calls with a partner both indoors and outside. For battery life, we play our test playlist on a loop with the volume around 75 percent and measure how long it takes for each set to drain. Where applicable, we do a thorough review of a pair’s companion app and test each available feature. While comfort is ultimately subjective, we take note of how secure each pair feels while we’re on the move. We also use certain pairs in especially crowded public spaces to get a better sense of their passive and active noise cancellation, as well as their ability to maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection.</p> 
<h2 id=""jump-link-recent-updates"">Recent updates</h2> 
<p><strong>May 2025</strong>: We’ve checked this guide to ensure our top picks still stand and noted a couple alternatives to the Noble Fokus Rex5, since that pair has had stock issues of late. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/tag/tariffs/"">tariff policy</a> affects the pricing and stock of our recommendations (and the consumer tech industry as a whole). All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.</p> 
<p><strong>February 2025</strong>: The Noble FoKus Rex5 is our new ""best for sound quality"" pick, replacing the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4. Our other recommendations remain unchanged.</p> 
<p><strong>December 2024</strong>: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and ensured that our current picks are still accurate.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-earbuds-for-android-devices-120015765.html?src=rss",10,20250508,https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-earbuds-for-android-devices-120015765.html?src=rss

<p>Much like we do for our guide to the <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html#how-we-test-tablets"">best tablets overall</a>, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like.

We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff.</p> <span id=""end-legacy-contents""></span>
<p>To help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.</p>

<p>If history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The <a class=""rapid-with-clickid"" href=""https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ebb3a818-66b3-46bf-98e3-16639ad8698a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vaXBhZG9zL2lwYWRvcy0xOC1wcmV2aWV3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiM2E4MTgtNjZiMy00NmJmLTk4ZTMtMTY2MzlhZDg2OThhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vaXBhZG9zL2lwYWRvcy0xOC1wcmV2aWV3LyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdM4XogbJXHbL1OUYwiyABxddkZBvWyN1I4hnKfURYDR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipados%2Fipados-18-preview%2F"">iPadOS 18 update</a>, for example, <a href=""https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/macos-sequoia-and-ipados-18-compatibility/"">is available</a> on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html"">iPad case</a>.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.</p> 
<h3 id=""jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-the-ipad-and-the-ipad-air"">What’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?</h3> 
<p>Compared to the 11th-gen iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple-intelligence/"">Apple Intelligence</a> and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/ipad-os-16-public-beta-preview-193037237.html"">Stage Manager</a>. Its display supports a wider <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3"">P3</a> color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html"">faster Wi-Fi 6E</a>, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Starting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/the-new-79-apple-pencil-has-a-usb-c-charging-port-141732710.html"">USB-C</a> Apple Pencils – which are <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-10th-generation-review-160014897.html"">more convoluted</a> to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the <a href=""https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vc2hvcC9zZWxlY3QtaXBhZC1rZXlib2FyZHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViYjNhODE4LTY2YjMtNDZiZi05OGUzLTE2NjM5YWQ4Njk4YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYr6D5fyvVZGUJfJ0ZmRXcoXzdAGDilzRWqO1gH7O44u&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fselect-ipad-keyboards&amp;uuid=DiDrMtUfvQdnYxtx38705"">Magic Keyboard Folio</a>.</p>

<p>As we note in our <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device-163053556.html"">screenshot how-to guide</a>, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.</p>
